I wasn't happy about it having Copilot at first (even without the Dragon chip it has a Copilot button) but as it turns out, Copilot is really good at tech support, and unlike googling, you can see the answers without all the annoying ads. The only disappointment is that the large touchpad makes it uncomfortable to type on when it is placed on a desk. It's find when it's on your lap but difficult to reach the keys when on a desk.

Best Buy made it extremely easy to turn in the first one in favor of the Envy. It is wonderful. The 17.3 inch screen was a must have and it is terrific while easy in my eyes.

I can't speak for how modern gaming goes on this laptop, but it handles Blender and some other 3D modeling programs well. I mainly use it for the aforementioned 3D modeling, as well as digital art, document creation. and general entertainment such as streaming, browsing, photo and video editing, and listening to music; it has excelled in delivering a fantastic experience in all those areas. Many people may not like that this laptop is a little on the heavier side, but personally I like it because it doesn't feel so fragile like a lot of other laptops do these days. It's definitely sturdy. I don't use any of the AI functions, and they're easy enough to turn off. It doesn't have a disc reader, but is compatible with aftermarket disc readers and has plenty of ports for other accessories.",

      "body": "After purchasing a new HP laptop, it took two tries to transfer and copy data from the hard drive of my old computer to this new one. Yesterday, my land-line telephone rang, but I didn't get to it in time to answer. I \"star-69ed\" to find out who had called and discovered it was The Geek Squad. I called back within a minute of having not been able to answer and finding out it was The Geek Squad to spending nearly 15 minutes on the phone with a virtual operator, then someone in a call center trying to verify information that I was indeed a customer. I provided all sorts of information, including my name, phone number, work order number, passcode, etc. and still couldn't get through to The Geek Squad office in my town. Therefore, I hung up and tried again a few minutes later. After a different person answered, she did take long to verify and transfer my call to the Greeley desk where someone actually responded to tell me my laptop was ready to be picked up for a second time. After driving back to the store again, I wanted to verify the data transfer was complete and accurate. Because my old computer had a hard drive that was beginning to fail, Jack told me my data had been transferred. He tried to show me but the process was taking a long time, and before the procedure had finished he compared on-screen the data in my new laptop to the data on my hard drive -- even though he couldn't access the old hard drive. So I took my new unit home and activated it, and slowly I'm learning how to use this new laptop. Through trial and error, I figured out how to activate my mouse and keyboard, finding out I must keep a USB port continually occupied by a connector for both a cordless mouse and cordless keyboard. I've also had trouble trying to access old Microsoft Word data and create new files, even though part of the price was an Office package that was supposed to make my efforts go smoothly. They have been anything but that. I'm hoping my experiences going forward are more rewarding because I'm questioning spending more than $1,300 on a device that so far has aggravated and frustrated me. My wife and I made a big decision to go with Best Buy and The Geek Squad based on recommendations from people we know. In the next week, I'm hoping to have a better grasp of the situation, or I'll find out spending this much money and effort was indeed a waste.",

I called BB to do an exchange because this all happened less than 2 weeks after purchase. According to the website, there weren't any available at the store closest to me. Well, I wasn't about to go driving across town to the next BB only to find out that they didn't have any. But, BB has made a change so that you cannot call the store directly to talk to a human who actually works there. Instead, no matter what store you call, you go right to a call center. Unfortunately, no one at the call center can understand or perform simple tasks. I just wanted to know if the BB store had the stock to do an even exchange. I spent hours dealing with these people via phone and chat. During that time I was transferred 6 times during the same conversation, received different answers to the same questions and my very simple problem was not solved. I returned the laptop to the closest store for a refund. Even the person at the BB customer svc desk said the call center is awful. Way to go BB. Because of your stupid policy to send all calls to a bunch of incompetent, rude idiots you lost a customer. I will not be purchasing anything from you again.  And I know one of them is going to respond to this review with a fake apology and claim to do better next time.  There won't be a next time!

The screen is unimpressive. Text is a bit blurry, especially when using \"dark mode\" which is what I use almost exclusively. There's a noticeable lack of contrast and a general haziness that I was unable to adjust out in display settings. It is noticeable if you set this laptop next to a different brand laptop of similar tier.\n\n2. The keyboard to me feels kind of cheap and rubbery. The keys are too soft and require to be pressed down further than most modern \"chicklet\" keyboards. It also gives the laptop a slightly outdated look.",

Everything is hazy, nothing is sharp. When I checked the resolution, it's lower than what the settings say they are and what the laptop is sold as. \n\nI have a hard time believing this laptop is supposed to be the \"advanced\" choice. It's clunky. The keyboard and mouse pad feel cheap - and the mouse pad is not silent like my old one, it constantly sounds like you are brushing fabric.\n\nI'm increasingly frustrated at how hard it is to find a decent sized keyboard on a laptop, and was really hoping this laptop would do the trick. But I will be returning it ASAP. The keys almost feel dusty/powdery. \n\n\nThis is the second time I have tried to replace my old laptop, and the second time I am returning it because it's so crappy it makes my old one feel brand new despite it's 24hr updates and cranky demeanor.

I was using a 1.0 hub with the pc. I bought a 2.0 hub for this laptop. I understand that a 3.2 hub is more than 10 times faster. So help me win that $400 gift card so I can buy that 3.2 hub. Thanks",

      "body": "I\u2019ve had nothing but trouble with HP laptops, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t recommend them to anyone. My experience has been a nightmare. After just about a year of use, my laptop completely broke down\u2014started with random screen flickering, then the keyboard stopped responding, and eventually, it wouldn\u2019t even turn on. It felt like it was built to fail.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is how quickly the battery life deteriorated. I remember when I first got it, I could use it for hours, but within a year, I could barely get through a couple of hours of work before it started dying on me. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating when you\u2019re paying for something that\u2019s supposed to last and it doesn\u2019t even come close.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on HP\u2019s customer service. Trying to get help or a replacement was a headache. It felt like they were avoiding responsibility, and I was left stuck with a broken laptop. They don\u2019t seem to care much about their products once they\u2019ve sold them to you.\n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop, HP is not the way to go. The poor build quality and frustrating customer support made my experience so much worse than it needed to be. I\u2019d never buy another one.",
