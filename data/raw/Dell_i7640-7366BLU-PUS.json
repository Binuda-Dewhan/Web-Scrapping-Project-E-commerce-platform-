As someone deeply involved in cybersecurity projects, I need a machine that can handle resource-intensive tasks seamlessly, and this laptop delivers.\n\nThe speed and performance are incredible\u2014whether I\u2019m running simulations, managing multiple applications, or handling large datasets, it never lags. The large memory capacity is another highlight. It easily supports all my projects, and I\u2019ve yet to worry about running out of space.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the 16-inch screen provides ample workspace, making it easy to multitask, and the display quality is fantastic for long hours of use. It\u2019s also lightweight enough to be portable, which is a plus for me as a student and professional.\n\nOverall, this laptop has exceeded my expectations.

I love that you can switch between keyboard and tablet modes. The backlight keyboard makes it very easy to work in low light or dark environments. AI support features are also helpful. I need a big screen and this computer size is perfect and big touchpad is also nice. Thin, amazing speaker volume, low blue light feature is awesome. One thing I will say is that it is heavy so not the easiest for mobility, but given the size of the computer it\u2019s expected, and the screen can get very glassy with light. Lastly, battery life is super good. \nGreat overall!!!",

The speakers sound a little bit like an echo but is not something I'm worried too much about. I use Photoshop, illustrator, and 3D rendering software and all run fine without any delays or freezing. The hinge into tablet mode is smooth and seems sturdy. You can't unlock it, if you're computer goes to sleep in tablet mode; so you do have to get back upright to log in. The battery life does well, you do have to charge it after using it for a full day. Overall, it is a great computer if you do light designing, school, and work.",

      "title": "A new high-end Dell Inspiron for content-creators",
      "body": "Quick Overview\n=================================\nIf you've kept up with Dell over the years, you may think (like I do) that they have WAY too many product lines and models to keep up with! Normally, we may be tempted to classify their Inspiron lineup of PCs with some \"basic\" computer users but not something premium, like their XPS line or an Apple MacBook Pro. Well, this is Dell's response - a high-quality all-metal, high-powered laptop that feels as premium as all but the best laptops out there. Let's see how it performs!\n\n\nOverall build\n=================================\nThe post-industrial recycled aluminum is as premium as they come and I love that the edges aren't sharp corners like you find on some MacBook Pros or Razer Blade laptops. Smooth edges all-around the laptop and a sturdy hinge make this feel like a premium 2-in-1. There's just enough \"give\" in the screen when you need to move it or flip it but it doesn't bounce at all while typing. On the left side, there are HDMI, USB-A, and two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports that can be used with the included 90w charger. On the right side, there's a USB-A, combo headset/headphone jack, and a full-sized SD card reader slot.\n\nThe backlit keyboard has very light actuation and is quiet. It's a bit too soft for my tastes (preferring mechanical keyboards or Lenovo Thinkpad-style keyboards), but others in the household thought it was fine. Note, this has a dedicated Microsoft Co-pilot key to the right of the spacebar (past the \"alt\" key) for instant access to Microsoft's Co-pilot.\n\nLarge speaker grilles on the left and right side of the keyboard deck house 2 speakers with Dolby Atmos Core/Waves MaxxAudio Pro certifications.\n\nThe screen is a nice 16\" 1920x1200 WVA display with 300 nits of brightness. It's decently color accurate (99.6% sRGB and 69.9% Adobe RGB), responsive to touch, and has very little to no backlight bleeding.\n\nOverall, I really like the build-quality and feel. Throughout my testing, it never got too hot to the touch, nor did the keyboard deck get overly warm.\n\n\n\n\nInitial setup\n=================================\nIf you've set up a Windows 11 PC recently, you know you've got 20-30 minutes of set up time to get online, download updates, and then decline a lot of Microsoft offerings. After all that is done, it's finally time to use the computer!\n\nI was very pleased with the input devices - the keyboard and large touchpad are responsive and the texture of scrolling on the trackpad is perfect. As mentioned, I didn't love the keyboard's softness (and I still don't), but I think it's something you can get used to if this was your main device. The touchscreen is nice and responsive. Interacting with content felt completely natural. I think a device this size is a bit too large to use as a tablet, but I could see this doing \"kiosk\" or \"tent\" duty as a media player.\n\nLoading up a few things to test including CPUID's HWmonitor, Adobe Creative Suite, and Davinci Resolve showed that this is more than capable as a content-creator's laptop.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n=================================\nThe stats on this Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 (7640) are impressive! An Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor (16 cores), 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB m.2 NVMe SSD, and Intel Arc graphics are high-end except for more of an integrated GPU vs. a truly dedicated one. Still, the performance on applications like benchmarks and real-world applications like Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Davinci Resolve were impressive. I didn't miss much compared to my high-end gaming PC that I usually run these tasks on. I will say, this Dell Inspiron 16 is much quieter, even at full-load, than my gaming PC. It never got annoyingly loud nor hot. Hot/warm keyboard decks can be annoying since they can make your palms sweat which isn't a great feeling. I did sense some warmth, but nowhere near what I've seen on some other devices.\n\nThe screen was accurate enough for me (not a professional photographer nor graphic designer, but I do have many creative pursuits) and comparing the built-in display to my external monitors had pretty similar results.\n\nI didn't personally test the SSD, but I felt like everything was very responsive (as they should be on something so highly spec'd). Checking online, this same SSD is highly rated and highly performant, so it's a great value that they included a 1 TB version in this model.\n\nIf you're a gamer, you'll always want dedicated graphics. If this is a hybrid-device that is intended as a workhorse first with the ability to occasionally play some older games, then Intel's integrated Arc GPU may work! I wouldn't recommend playing Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings, but older games like less-graphically intense FPS/shooters, RPGs, or strategy games work great. For example, Civilization VI can break 60 fps at medium settings. Since I have a backlog of games I'll never get under control, a device like this could help me knock out some of the older titles I've always meant to get around to.\n\nConnectivity-wise, I had no issues with Intel's Wi-Fi 6E AX211 NIC and my home 6E system. I wouldn't have minded if it had an RJ45 port on it, but I totally understand why they decided to leave it off. Physically there were plenty of ports and I never felt the need (like I do on some thin/light laptops) to get the dongles out to have enough ports.\n\nThe speakers, though certified, are better than OK. I recently had the pleasure of testing out Asus' G14's speakers and they are super-impressive for laptop speakers. These Inspiron 16 speakers are good - certainly better than most laptops and much better than most tablets (my Samsung S8 Ultra or Asus Z13 Flow).\n\nBattery life is long enough to last a full day of working away from power outlets and when you do get access to one, you can charge up to 80% in just an hour. \n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the performance of the very new Intel CPU/GPU combination. It's fast, powerful, and quiet!\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n=================================\nI was really impressed by this new Inspiron 16. I never would have considered buying an Inspiron before since I could choose from either Alienware, XPS, or even their business-focused Latitude line. This new Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 really improves my impression of their Inspiron line up which was, uninspiring to say the least. I can confidently say that this new model is a solid, high-quality, high-performing PC that can do WAY more than just browse the web and pay bills online. These specs, along with the Intel Arc GPU, really allow this PC to do some content-creation, media editing, and light gaming.",

      "title": "Awesome looking Laptop and performs like a premium",
      "body": "Look and Feel \n--------------------\nA mega display touch enabled laptop that\u2019s just so easy to work on. Having been using phones for so long, it comes naturally to touch the screen for inputs. And touch enabled laptops are so convenient that way. The ice blue color gives it a cool look.  \n\n\nBuild Quality  \n------------------\nA 360\u00b0 hinge transforms laptop into four modes \u2013 laptop, tent, stand and Tab mode. Transition is pretty smooth and keypad disables by itself for tent, stand and tab modes. The TAB mode is brilliant - just like a huge tab, it automatically changes orientation based on how we hold the laptop. This is especially useful when we read an e-book or documents and feels awesome when we play games. \nAt around 4.8 lbs (2.2 kg) this may not be on the lighter side, but it\u2019s not difficult to carry around. With less than an inch of height, this is slim. With minimal bezel, this feels quite compact for a 16 inch laptop. \n \nBoot Speed \n----------------\nWith only about 15 seconds boot time, this is extremely quick to load the lock screen. Fingerprint sensor is excellent and really fast making it extremely convenient to unlock the laptop. Overall the desktop loads within about 18 seconds from the time the laptop is powered on. Another great feature is, opening the lid automatically powers on the laptop. If the lid is already open, fingerprint button does the trick. This is very practical and well done DELL!\n\nDisplay Quality \n---------------------\n16 inch Full HD+ touch display with aspect ratio of 16:10 (1920 x 1200) with max brightness of 300 nits. Thanks to 300 nits, its super bright, usable outdoors as well. I generally use it at 50% brightness. This features ComfortView Plus Support through MyDell app offering additional display settings like Comfortview (with blue light filters), movie, sports and animation mode and brings improvement and Dolby Vision optimized for bright, dark and vivid environments. \n\nI also use a 14 inch Dell Inspiron and in comparison this definitely feels superb. The display is much larger and it\u2019s so nice to use a larger display. It\u2019s like the difference we feel between a 6 inch and a 6.7 inch phone. With a larger display (and the additional battery capacity) the weight of the laptop increases but in my opinion, the pleasure of the larger display topples the hassles of the additional weight.\n\nWebcam\n------------\nWith 1080p resolution, the webcam provides an excellent quality video during the calls. This also comes with a privacy shutter to close the camera when needed (or not needed).  \n\nBattery  \n------------\nThis has an outstanding battery life. With a 6-cell 90 WHr high-capacity battery, DELL claims 15 hour battery life. It just took 1 hour to charge from 0 to 80%. 1 hr and 35 minutes for a full charge. After full charging it on day 1, I am on day 4 and used about a couple of hours per day and am still at 48%. This includes a 1 hour video call as well. \n\nSpeakers\n--------------\nThis comes with Dolby Atmos Quad speakers and its really loud. This is another area where this laptop beats the DELL Inspiron 14 by a huge margin. \n\nProcessor \n-------------\nThis laptop comes with Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H processor and 16GB RAM and preloaded with Windows 11 Home 64 bit OS. \nThis is one of the high end processor and the laptop has no lag in launching or switching between all the apps that I am using. It\u2019s extremely fast, be it loading the apps or switching between them. Ultra 7 means this laptop will support AI as well. \n1 TB Solid State drive offers plenty of storage space and thankfully this doesn\u2019t have an internal hard disc and the entire storage is SSD offering greater speed and no noise. \n\nGames \n----------\nThis is not meant to be a high end gaming laptop and this is not made for this purpose. However, thanks to Intel Arc graphic card, this supports many mid level games. For someone like me, who play mid level games occasionally, this has proved more than sufficient. I was able to play games like F1 2020 with no difficulties which requires moderate graphics requirement. \n\nKeyboard and Trackpad \n---------------------------------\nThis is another area where this laptop excels. The keypad feels soft, rich and premium, almost no sound. The backlit keyboard is really handy when used in dark. The trackpad is huge and very responsive and I could use it with \u201clow\u201d sensitivity to prevent accidental taps. The keypad could have been positioned slightly lower than they are. But I almost got used to it in no time.  \n\nWiFi \n--------\nWiFi 6E, the new technology offers superior connectivity. There were no drops and seems reliable. This is also capable of sharing WiFi internet with mobile hotspot feature. \n\nPorts\n---------\nIt is equipped with all the necessary ports. \n- 2 thunderbolts USB-C ports \n- 2 USB A ports on either side of the laptop\n- 1 HDMI 1.4 port (Please note, the maximum resolution supported over HDMI is 1920x1080 @60HZ. There is no 4K output)\n- 1 3.5mm Audio jack (Obviously laptop can be connected via Bluetooth audio devices for videos and calls)\n- 1 SD Card reader\n\nHardware\n-------------\nThis being the core of the laptop, I am so glad this laptop has checked all the boxes in this front. \n- 16GB LPDDR5X RAM offers more than necessary speed to tackle all day to day needs including video editing. \n- Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra 7 processor 155H Processor keeps the laptop fast and efficient\n- 1 TB and the highlight is its all Solid State Drive (SSD). This is more than adequate storage and not having a HDD is a blessing. No more irritating HDD rotating sounds and loading of any files/programs/apps is so quick. This is perfect. \n\nOS: This comes with Windows 11 Home edition pre-installed. Additionally, 1 month free trial of Office 365 and McAfee is included. \n\n\nSummary\n-------------\nAfter using the 14 inch DELL Inspiron for a while, this DELL Inspiron 16 feels an obvious upgrade. Superb larger display and much high brightness. Sound is much louder. \nAll the applications and games I have used thus far are super quick and had no hassles operating them. \n\nIf you cant decide between a 14 and 16 inch DELL Inspiron, I would recommend the 16 inch. Especially, if you do not connect to an external monitor, then I would definitely suggest to go with a larger display such as this, as the 14\u201d feels a bit smaller. Plus the added advantage of superior sound, higher end processor. \n\nOverall I am very happy with this laptop and I have no hesitation to recommend this.",

      "body": "The Dell Inspiron 16 7640 2-in-1 laptop is  new convertible laptop from Dell. It blends versatility, power, and style into one neat package!\n\nDell calls the case color Ice Blue, but it looks more like a medium metallic grey. The keyboard has matching color keys with blue backlighting, including a new copilot key next to the right alt key for quick access to Copilot. With a double-hinged screen, it can be used as a laptop, tablet or in tent configuration, providing maximum flexibility for work or play.\n\nThe laptop features a 16-inch 16:10 FHD+ touchscreen with a max resolution of 1920 x 1200.

The laptop is fitted with 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and is expandable to 32GB this allows plenty of memory for any program.  Storage is handled by a fast 1TB Sk hyinx BC901 NVME SSD.  Windows 11 Home is included, you may want to upgrade to Windows 11 pro if you need to join a domain at work or need the extra security features. This laptop stays cool and quiet due to the Dell Advanced cooling system. \n\nThe backlit keyboard has a great feel and a cool blue glow. The keys have good travel and recoil. There is an integrated fingerprint reader in the power button at the right end of the upper row of keys that supports windows hello, sadly the webcam does not support it. The trackpad is large and has good sensitivity with good feel while clicking.\n\nThe laptop has four tuned speakers with audio processing by Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro, delivering an immersive sound experience. I was surprised by the sound from the built in speakers. They are more than adequate for any media streaming and lite gaming.  The integrated widescreen FHD webcam with dual digital microphone array and Temporal Noise Reduction ensures clear video calls.\n\nWith a 6-cell, 90 WHr high-capacity battery and ExpressCharge capability, the laptop offers outstanding battery life, i got between 6 and 7 hours per charge. The laptop has two charging modes using Standard charge the laptop charges fully charge in 3 hours  With  ExpressCharge  you can charge  in a little over 2 hours, from 0 to 80% in 75 minutes and 100% in 135 minutes.\n\nAnother cool feature is Intel Unison which allows you to sync your laptop with any phone, regardless of OS and transfer file, photos or video. You will have to download the app to your phone or your tablet to  use it.\n\nAdvanced features are available due to the Integrated AI NPU that enables features like Windows Studio Effects for background blur and tracking.

      "title": "Overall, a very good laptop for the money",
      "body": "First, I was a little disappointed to find that my new Dell Inspiron 16\u201d 7640 2-in-1 Touch Laptop arrived with a small scuff on the left front corner of the lid.  The shipping box and product box were both undamaged, leaving me to assume that this brand-new laptop was shipped from Dell already scuffed.\n\nI have been happy with Dell products for years.  In fact, our family currently owns several Dell laptops and are happy with all of them.\n\nThis happens so transparently anymore, that I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s even worth mentioning, but as always during setup, this Dell Inspiron 7640 connected easily to my home\u2019s Wi-Fi.  It quickly found my Wi-Fi and several of our neighbors and all I had to do was select our home\u2019s Wi-Fi and provide the password.  It has reliably reconnected each time I booted up the laptop.\n\nOne of the first things I do when I get a new laptop is listen to the sound.  I typically don\u2019t have high expectations for any laptop\u2019s built-in speakers, because most everybody nowadays connects by Bluetooth to high-quality external speakers, headphones, or earbuds.  But usually, laptop speakers are at least passable for listening.\n\nUnfortunately, that seems to be a weak point on the Inspiron 7640.  Even though it boasts 2x2W Dolby Atmos quad built-in speakers, they must be really poor quality, and I would rate them not even passable.  They would be okay for online meetings or listening to voice-only videos, but not music.  I\u2019m not sure how to describe the sound from these speakers other than they sound exactly like you would expect very cheap speakers to sound\u2026tinny highs, no discernible bass at all, and almost no pleasant mid-tones.  I did not drop this review by a star for this because nobody really expects to listen to music using just a laptop speakers.\n\nBut once it effortlessly, connected it to my wife\u2019s new Bluetooth speaker it was game on, and we listened to hours upon hours of streamed music through this laptop.  It kept a solid Bluetooth connection with absolutely no skipping, stuttering, or dropouts.\n\nA big plus for this Inspiron 7640 is its processor speed.  This is a very fast computer boasting one of the latest generation CPUs, the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H.  It\u2019s basic speed is 1.4 GHz jumping to 4.8 GHz in turbo mode and can handle up to 22 threads.  I give this CPU package high marks for overall speed.\n\nMy Inspiron 7640 came equipped with, not just a 1 TB SSD, but a 1 TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe Solid State Drive, the fastest form factor available.  I was also happy to see that my Inspiron came with an SD card slot.  A lot of laptops these days are being made without an SD card slot thus forcing you into buying USB-C accessories just read an SD card.\n\nThe FHD+ display quality is really pretty decent.  The touchscreen display and its hinge seem to be well engineered because the screen doesn\u2019t shake at all even up near the top like when you\u2019re using the ribbon menu in Office products.  The well-engineered hinge is stiff, yet it\u2019s not too stiff.  I\u2019m still able to open the clam shell lid easily.\n\nI have a disability with my hands that affects my hand strength, touch sensation, fine motor control, and dexterity.  Happily, I found the touchpad on this new Dell Inspiron to have just enough drag on my fingertips for me to accurately control it with my messed-up hands.  This is a critical factor for me when choosing laptops because if the touchpad is too slick, I\u2019m unable to control it properly and then I have to use an external mouse which is not always desired or convenient.\n\nDell\u2019s backlit keyboard is great when using the Inspiron in a lowlight environment.  I absolutely love that feature and also the fact that I can easily turn it on/off with the F5 key only.\n\nThe life of a full battery charge is most excellent, taking over 14 hours to drop from a 100% battery down to 1%.  My basic test for battery is to stream music videos to an external Bluetooth speaker.  I was overjoyed at this incredible battery charge life.  My last new Dell Inspiron two years ago took 8\u00bd hours to reach 2%.  That\u2019s roughly a 40% increase in battery charge life!  I\u2019m very happy with that!  On the downside, I was disappointed to find out that the 7640\u2019s battery is not replaceable.\n\nOverall, the Dell Inspiron 16 7640 2-in-1 Laptop is a very decent laptop that I can recommend to anyone without reservation as long as you\u2019re not looking for something with excellent built-in speakers.  My Inspiron 7640 appears to be a workhorse of a laptop that would be quite at home in a student\u2019s backpack, in a contractor's pickup truck, on a desk at work, or on the dining room table at home.",

      "body": "The Dell - Inspiron 16\u201d 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 is a well-rounded, full featured daily laptop.\n\n\nPhysical presentation \u2013\nThis Inspiron 2-in-1 is noticeably heavier than other ultra notebooks in my arsenal but being that this machine is 16 inch \u2013 I don\u2019t consider it a show stopper.  The color tone, rounded edges and layout are great.  The screen is vastly uniform but not that bright, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend this machine for anyone prone to using it outdoors or in work areas saturated with a lot of ambient light.  Color, range of brightness control and again \u2013 uniformity - are all excellent.  But this display is glossy and lacking any kind of \u201cPop\u201d.  Being a pen compatible touch screen is a nice bonus.\n\nThe touch-pad is remarkably good, large and with an excellent surface that affords precise control.  That part was unexpected.  The port selection on this laptop is well balanced and left me wanting for anything more.  The keyboard is sort of meh to my tastes but not horrible.  It will take a little of time to get use to the tactical feedback of the keys, their size & placement.  I have preference for Lenovo keyboards on laptops but this Inspiron isn\u2019t far below that experience.  The keyboard deck located power button with integrated finger print reader is convenient and makes using Windows Hello logins confident and quick.\n\nThe charging brick and USB-C connector are great.  Good for traveling and flexible if one wishes to use an external battery pack or alternate charging brick on trips.\nThe built in camera does have a physical privacy slider and that is a feature I think many people will appreciate.  One thing I noticed is that as you tilt the screen back, the hinges of this Inspiron will raise the base further off the table surface \u2013 providing better breath-ability \u2013 which is good \u2013 but \u2013 since there isn\u2019t any type of protective treatment to that part of the hinge surfaces, I expect that the finish will wear in these spots with continue use.  This feels like a bit of an oversight by the Dell engineers IMHO.\nOverall, I feel this 2024 16-inch Inspiron configuration hits all the most important design points and has a build quality you\u2019d expect for the price-point.\n\nSetup \u2013\nThis newest 14th Gen Core Ultra was a breeze to get going.  There were a couple of firmware updates straight out-of-the-box and the entire process of initializing Windows 11 and updating all drivers/utilities was pleasant & painless.  The newly improved Dell Support utility does a great job of scanning the machine and keeping you informed of available updates.  I only experienced that \u2018typical of Dell\u2019 handful of drivers that failed during the Windows Update process \u2013 namely a couple of Intel related drivers \u2013 but unlike my previous experience with their computers, these self-corrected quickly with no headaches.\n\nPerformance \u2013\nPlease note that all these benchmarks were performed in Balanced Mode while plugged in, with Window 11 Home fully up-to-date at version 23H2.\nThe included 1 TB SSD is obviously geared towards optimizing battery performance and is nothing to \u2018write home about\u2019 but the responsiveness of the system never presented any kind of sluggish or \u201cheld back\u201d feeling in normal use.  Write & read speeds were consistently sub-5GB/sec but certainly not horrible.  I personally hold more importance of storage capacity over speed in a platform of this nature.\nThis machine, not specifically spec\u2019d as a Content Creator platform does perform remarkably well and I attribute that to competency of the newest, 14th Gen Ultra Core i7\u2019s.  The Ultra 7 155H in this Dell - Inspiron 16\u201d 2-in-1 Touch Laptop should satisfy most users not expecting the performance levels of more professionally leaning, spec\u2019d machines.  For the average Joe (and Josephine), this machine will handle video & audio rendering just fine \u2013 which is another revealing fact of the Intel\u2019s newest Ultra processors.  This laptop scores Cinebench nearly as good as much more expensive machines, only a couple/three generations older.\n\nSummary \u2013\nThe Dell - Inspiron 16\u201d 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 is solid offering from Dell.  The build quality is what you\u2019d expect from them, with all modern & essential features here and the performance being solid for an Ultra book style platform at this particular price-point \u2013 all with a spacious 16-inch, touch display.  This is a very competent, everyday laptop that should satisfy most users.\n\nPros\nBig, uniform touch display that is pen compatible.\nExcellent, spacious track pad that isn\u2019t glass but feels just a good as some of the precision glass ones I\u2019ve used.\nPhysical camera privacy slider.\nReliable & quick booting, waking and logging in with finger print reader integrated power button.\nDell support utilities have been greatly improved this year and are useful without all the bugs!\nWiFi connections are solid & reliable with this Intel AX211 6e onboard device\nGood balance of ports and includes a full-sized SD card slot!\nOverall system performance is crisp & responsive.\n\nCons\nA few extra levels of added screen brightness would have been preferred for better outdoor use\nNot a huge fan of the chic-let keys size & spacing but are still good to type on\nGoofy hinge design",

      "title": "Great 2-in-1 laptop for home/small business users.",
      "body": "I was looking for a new Windows 11 laptop that I could take on the road and use for my remote photo/video editing and the usual home office applications.  I have used this laptop for 5 days now and I really love it.  I feel this laptop would work very well for most advanced home users wanting a larger screen and don't mind the extra weight.  Also, I feel the 2-in-1 feature would work perfectly for some small business users.\n\nThe 16\" screen and 2-in-1 capability have really worked out perfectly for what I use this for.  I was able to install my photo and video editing software and they run smooth and cool with the Intel Ultra 7 155H processor.  It has plenty of venting and fans to keep the laptop cool.  I rarely hear the fans running.  This laptop is fast and startup time and shutdown time is very quick.  I have also taken this on flights and used it to watch a movie and didn't experience any lag.  Even after installing MS-Office and my finance software, everything runs great.\n\nThe weight is a little heavy, but I feel that is the trade-off for the 16\" flip touch screen.  The sound and Intel Arc graphics quality are very good.  I would have liked a 2k or greater resolution, but at this price point FHD+ (1920 x 1200) fits better with my budget.  It is engineered with 4-speakers that have Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro.  Which makes watching a movie in a lonely hotel room seem a lot more tolerable.  This laptop also comes with WiFi 6E for fast internet access and has 2 USB-C (Thunderbolt 4.0) ports and 2 USB-A (3.2 gen 1) ports.  However, I would have traded one of the USB-A ports for another USB-C port, because one USB-C port is used for charging, leaving only 1 open.  An HDMI port, Audio Port, and SD card slot complete the laptop's connectivity perfectly.\n\nMost importantly, I haven't had any problems with this laptop since I started using it.  It connects quickly and easily to my wireless BT mouse, keyboard, and headphones.  The keyboard is very comfortable to use and has a nice, light touch and sound.  They also added a fingerprint reader and a Windows Copilot key to the keyboard.  The display panel includes an integrated Webcam (1080p) with dual noise cancelling microphones.  The video quality of the webcam and sound quality of the microphone is very good.  I regularly give remote presentations to clients and they haven't yet complained that they couldn't hear or see me well.\n\nThe 16GB memory and 1TB SSD storage are adequate for me.  Also, I did notice that Dell responded to a Q&A that the memory is upgradeable to 32GB.  But, it is the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H (24MB cache, 16 cores, 22 threads, up to 4.8 GHz), Intel Arc Graphics, and 16GB memory (LPDDR5X at 6400MT/s) that really makes this laptop standout.  These are upgrades for many laptops and all of my applications run very quick.  Even when I am listening to music and editing some photos or videos at the same time.\n\nSo far I have used this laptop to watch movies on the plane and in a hotel room, do some quick photo/video while traveling, upload files to social media, and stay up-to-date with internet, email, Zoom, and give presentations for my clients.  Overall, I really like everything about the Dell Inspiron 16\" 2-in-1 touch laptop with these specifications and features.  I also feel the price makes this a very good value given Dell's reputation, and their quality and commitment to service.  I highly recommend this laptop and it would make a great present.",

Now if I can figure out this copilot thing my daughter said helped her re-do her resume, it would be great! The bonus for me was getting it while on sale and \"excellent\" open-box from my local BB for about 45% off the regular price! Sweet!",

      "body": "PRODUCT REVIEWED\n\nDell - Inspiron 16\u201d 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor - 16GB Memory - 1TB SSD \u2013 Intel Arc Graphics - Ice Blue\nModel: i7640-7366BLU-PU\n\nREVIEW\n\nAs a gamer I always want more power, more screen, more RAM, more of everything.    In this case I just need a sturdy and reliable laptop with a touchscreen, for my Wife, to replace her aging Dell 2-in-1 Laptop from around 2016.  My wife uses her laptop for crafting, doing puzzles, and couch surfing.   She required a touch screen, and something with solid performance.   Although her old Dell laptop is 4K/16GB with a budget GPU, I can\u2019t say she knows what that means or even cares.  \n\nSo, from her context, this is more or less a 1:1 replacement at the same price point as 7 years ago.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nAs expected, and as previously experienced with other Dell\u2019s, the Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 is well built and solidly constructed.  The screen is vibrant and bright (300 nits) it will do OK outdoors, but not outstanding in full sun.\n\nSome upgrades that I appreciate is a full 1080p camera, that does a good job on video calls.  I also like the full Wi-Fi 6e support for faster connectivity.  The battery life is much better than on older models and reportedly can exceed 15 hours.  In a few days of testing, the battery has held up well.\n\nFinally, I like the combination of ports.  Thunderbolt 4 ports means I can easily dock this laptop to an external docking station for ease of use or expand the laptop with more USB ports if needed without impacting performance.   I\u2019m also happy to see a real, and full-size HDMI port, in case I need to connect to older monitors (instead of thunderbolt 4 / DisplayPort over USB).  I am curious about the \u201c*\u201d in the specs that state you can only drive a 1080p monitor from the HDMI port.    This is curious, but must be real if they put a disclaimer on the spec sheet.  That does not seem to apply to the Thunderbolt connectivity.  I\u2019m driving a 4K external screen for my testing with it just fine (3 screens at once were not issue from my dock).  I do wish it had a built in ethernet port, but that is not a big deal for most people and can easily be solved with a docking station anyway.\n\nSETUP\n\nAs with all Win11 laptops, just follow along and you are setup, so that part is easy.  Other than \u201cDell branded\u201d bloatware and McAfee, this was not much to uninstall.\n\nTESTING\n\nI\u2019m not going to go crazy with testing and specs (I\u2019m fighting my geek instincts here).  The Dell seems responsive, the keyboard is nice.  I hate touchpads and so does my wife, but with a touch screen and external mouse, that is not an issue.   I was able to get the expected speeds from my external Thunderbolt 4 drive.  You are not going to be doing much of any gaming with this laptop, other than online games, so there is no need to test graphics performance on AAA games.\n\nOK I had to do one test, more for curiosity, than any actual need.  The Drive in my build is a KIOXIA (never heard of it), but performance was top notch for an NVME Gen 4 drive 6K Read / 5K Write.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIf you want a well-built laptop for everyday use (not gaming), that will hold up for years, I think this is worth a close look.   It is in the high-end price range for the class of screen, but if it holds up as well as my previous four 2-in-1 Inspirons, then it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.   None of my prior four Inspirons ever died or failed after, even after 5-7 years of adult use.  It was just time for upgrades.  The only thing slightly lacking is a built in 4K screen, but it is not a big deal for this use.",

It was important for this laptop to meet all the school's requirements, to have a backlit keyboard, good graphics, battery life, work for occasional gaming (although he does that mostly on his custom-built gaming PC, just games on this when he's home for short breaks). I read all the reviews, and this laptop really impressed me. We love the touchscreen/2-1 feature and security of this laptop - he likes to flip it around and set it up to stream shows. My only negative, is its weight but it's not a big deal to my son, so it's fine!",

This is the only reason I gave the overall rating that I did.  It's your time you should not pay for it as well.",

      "body": "Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1, 7640 Laptop is a nice upgrade from my most recent Dell Inspiron 7000!  I have a few Dell computers/laptops and this one did not disappoint.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 processor, Windows 11, 1 TB storage, 16GB memory, with 16\u201d display.  It comes with 30-day Trial offer for Microsoft Office, 4.8lbs, 4 speakers, Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro, Integrated FHD Webcam and digital microphone, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth wireless card and a 90Wh Battery (battery life up to 15 hrs), power cable, and a little paper with QR code and warranty paper included.\n\nOut of the very well packaged box this is an Ice Blue 2-in-1 Laptop that is a little on the heavy side \u2013 but very sturdy!  This is replacing (working with) my other 2019 Dell 2-in1 and I am very pleased so far!  The laptop booted up very quickly as I just followed along, made my selections and was on my way! It had a semi charged battery that lasted for a while before I had to recharge.  After selecting my network, it checked and installed updates \u2013 again quickly.  I linked my printers and phone to the new Dell and imported some data from my 2019 Dell easily.  I am not really a gamer aside from Solitaire and some word games so probably won\u2019t take full advantage of all gaming capabilities of this computer.  I do, however, do my work, documents, web searches etc. from this and it is a very capable laptop.  I have had no issues, battery performance is great, the laptop stays pretty cool for the hours I am on it, and it wakes right up when I open it.  The audio is very good with the side speakers on the keyboard area; however, I am sad that the speakers take up so much of the keyboard area and did not allow for the number pad on the right side\u2026 tough to get used to no number pad/calculator option.  This has probably been my biggest challenge \u2013 getting used to the finger positioning of the keyboard.  On that topic, the keyboard keys are a bigger size and comfortable to use and I like the backlit keyboard.\n\nThis comes with a Windows Copilot Key that kind of gives you an AI assistant which is helpful finding you answers and solutions!  It also has 2 thunderbolt USB-C ports (very useful for me to link my Samsung phone cord to) and also the laptop charging cord, 2 USB A ports on either side, an HDMI port, an audio jack and my favorite is the SD card reader!\n\nThe 2-in-1 hinge feature is strong and very useful when watching a movie or showing a slide show.  The colors are vibrant and easy on the eye.  All in all, this is a very nice, capable, upgraded Dell computer/laptop that has a competitive price point and I think is a great product by Dell.",

      "title": "Another amazing laptop from Dell!",
      "body": "After all these years, Dell is still putting out amazing computers and setting the bar for what laptops should be! I cant even count how many Dell laptops I have owned over the years, and they have always been very solid, quality, well-built machines.  This laptop is no different.  Out of the box you will see this is a quality machine.  It has a good weight to it (some may think it\u2019s a little on the heavier side) but I think its on par considering it\u2019s a 16\u201d laptop.  I believe the spec sheet says its 4.8 pounds.  \nIn the box you just get the basics, the laptop, power cable, and some minor documentation and that\u2019s it.  \nWhen you start up the laptop you\u2019ll see the advantage of the fast processor and 1TB SSD.  This thing boots up in a matter of seconds.  You\u2019ll have to go through the usual Windows setup before you can use the laptop.  Once you're finished with that, you\u2019ll see that Dell doesn\u2019t include too much bloatware.  That\u2019s one thing I always loved about Dell.  They usually keep it pretty simple and only include the essentials and a few trials of things like Office and Antivirus programs. \nThe display is very nice looking, sad that its only 1920 X 1200 FHD+, I would have liked to see a slightly higher resolution for the price point, but for most people, it will be fine.  \nThe keyboard Dell uses in their laptops always has a good feel to them and I find it very easy to type quickly on them.  As always, it is also backlit so its great for working at night or in dimly-lit spaces. \nThe ins and outs should be enough for most people.  On one side there are 2 USB-C ports (that are also used for charging), one regular USB port and a full-size HDMI port.  On the other side is a SD card reader, headphone jack, and a second regular USB port.  \nGetting into the performance, this has an Intel Core 7 Series 1 processor with 16GB of Ram, a 1TB SSD drive and Intel Arc graphics.  I use mine mainly for browsing the web, checking emails, watching streaming movies as well as for more work-oriented stuff like Photoshop, Illustrator, and video editing with Premiere.  One of my main hobbies is flying my drone.  I love that there is a SD card slot so I can easily transfer my videos to the large hard drive and that there is plenty of power for me to easily be able to edit my footage and get it uploaded to YouTube.  I also regularly use Photoshop to edit photos as well and this machine can easily handle editing of very large files without any hiccups.  \nFor fun I also installed some games on this to se how the gaming performance would be.  It\u2019s acceptable, but this is far from a gaming machine.  But for keeping yourself occupied on the road, it will definitely be able to do that! \nI also love that this is a 2 in 1 machine so it can be completely folded in half and used as a tablet.  I have always loved having this feature on a laptop because its just 1 less gadget you have to haul around with you.  \nI found the battery life to be great on this laptop.  As always, it depends heavily on what you are using it for and the CPU load and your settings, but I found this to be as good or even slightly better than most laptops in this spec range.  \nI think this would be great as a daily laptop.  It can easily handle most office tasks and is great for kicking back at home and watching videos or doing other fun productivity work.  \nAs I always say, you can\u2019t go wrong with a Dell.  They are solid machines built with quality parts that perform great! Definitely check this out if you are in the market for a new laptop.",

      "body": "This laptop 2-in-1 is quite heavy.  I don't see a lot of people being able to use it as a tablet lying down.  In a A frame setup it works quite nicely.  The monitor is crystal clear and touch is very responsive.  A stylus will work with the touch screen.\n\nAs a laptop, don't expect to do heavy gaming.  You do not have a dedicated graphics card (Intel Arc Graphics), so my performance tests scored it low in 3D and 2D results.  It still managed a very respectable score near the 70th percentile.  This is actually quite surprising for a 2-in-1.  You can make it by with mid to low graphics on some intensive games.  But you are not going to replace a gaming laptop or rig with this.\n\nWhat this laptop does well is a little bit of everything.  It is a perfect size for coding, Office work, browsing and media consumption.  The colors are fantastic.  The air flow seems to be quite good.  I have not felt it overly warm at any point.  \n\nThe exterior is quite smooth and slick.  Folding it into table mode has the keyboard exposed on the back.  This gives a little better grip to the tablet mode.\n\nIn laptop mode, the keyboard is backlit and the touchpad is massive and very responsive.  \n\nThe Inspiron is just a touch below the XPS series of laptops from Dell.  This is much more a business type laptop.  Overall it is perfect for my son and his coding classes at school.  It is heavy but the screen real estate makes the weight worth it.  \n\nThe ability to flip into a A frame mode and connect a external mouse and keyboard is a big plus.  This is something that differentiates the Inspirons from the XPS.  \n\nYou have ports for USB (2) and USB C (2) as well as full size HDMI (1).  The power cord is USB C/Thunderbolt 4.0, this will burn one of the USB C ports.  I always keep a USB hub or two handy.  \n\nProcessor is a i7.  There is 16 GB of memory.  There is a finger print reader that works very well.  Also the graphics is Intel Arc, decent performance but really helps the battery life.\n\nBattery life has been really good so far.  Under a moderate load while installing software and configuring Windows I only used about 10% of the battery.  That was over about an hour to an hour and a half.  Lots of IO during that time and screen was on constant.  It charges quite quickly as well.  Unfortunately I did not time that.\n\nOverall, I like this 2-in-1 especially using it for general purposes. It performs well enough that it is perfect for business use, class use, coding and doing presentations.   If you aren't wanting to play No Mans Sky on max graphics, you will be quite pleased with this laptop.",

      "body": "I was skeptical at first, but this thing impressed me. The 2-1 Inspiron has a very good touch screen and build quality. The battery life is good, it last multiple days for me when not in ALL day use (9+ hours straight). 16gb ram is impressive for the price point as well as 1TB SSD. I got this on sale at $750 with a regular price of right at $1100. Seemed too good to be true but did not disappoint whatsoever. I run multiple applications, and have at least 5 tabs open with no slow down. Set up was easy and then I upgraded some drivers on my own. It can run multiple external monitors fluidly with no lag. It handles work task very good. Intel Core ULTRA 7 is a big perk as it\u2019s a top of the line processor. I didn\u2019t want to break the bank but I needed a solid build and good performing laptop. This is the one. I love Dell over other brands, but have not had one in a few years. This laptop overall is a great all in one. Especially if bought on sale. The 2-1 feature is pretty cool even though I don\u2019t use it much it\u2019s still cool to flip over and use it for a demonstration. It doesn\u2019t run hot like people have complained, it gets warm, but don\u2019t all laptops to do that eventually? It is not an overheating type heat either, it just gets warm. Very tolerable and normal. This laptop is a good deal. I hope this helped someone.",

I wanted to use the Windows Media Creation tool, but the C drive was not listed an installation. I then went to Dell website to download the Micron SSD drivers. When I entered my service, it was already registered in Brazil !!! Then I saw a small, triangular blue,grey and white sticker that I never really looked at closely before. It has Dell colors. But it wasn't dell. It had a certification# from a company so I went to that company's site and it's a REFURBISHING company.\nThat explains everything!!!

      "body": "I have been using my new Dell - Inspiron 16\u201d 2-in-1 Touch Laptop for a few days now and it is well on its way to replacing my older desktop PC.  I just need to finish installing a bunch more programs and transfer all my docs, pics and videos to it.  Dell was able to fit desktop level performance components into a relatively slim package at about \u00be\u201d thick and about 4.8 lbs.  This model comes with the latest generation Intel Core Ultra 7 - 155H CPU w/16-cores and Max Turbo Boost Frequency up to 4.8 GHz.  When it comes to multi-tasking for work or play this is a true workforce.  Moreover the 16 GB of high speed DDR5 memory is plenty to simultaneously run many modern apps, create and edit large documents, graphics, videos, spreadsheets and presentations.  Also contributing to the stellar performance is the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive that helps boot this laptop in less than 20 seconds.  The Intel Arc graphics is no slouch either.  It offers about 150% boost in benchmark performance over last generation Intel Iris Xe graphics.  It\u2019s great for everyday home and business use and light to medium gaming..  The 16\u201d LED touchscreen has very bright and vivid colors in FHD+ resolution (1920x1200) with very thin bezels, great for work productivity and HD movies. Speaking of HD movies, this laptop has 4 Dolby Atmos speakers built-in for some of the most immersive sound you can get from a laptop. Additionally it also incorporates a 1080p webcam but no infrared sensors used by Windows Hello for face recognition to unlock your computer.  You can use the built-in fingerprint reader to unlock your screen instead. Another nice touch is the backlit keyboard which makes this laptop easy to type on in any lighting conditions.\n\nAs for external connectivity, the Inspiron 16\u201d 7640 is well equipped with two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A for legacy devices and two USB-C Thunderbolt 4.0 ports and an SD-card reader. The laptop also comes with the latest generation low-power consumption Bluetooth as well a very fast  Intel\u00ae Wi-Fi 6E AX211, 2x2, 802.11ax wireless card.  Last but not least, an HDMI 1.4 port offers quick connectivity to a TV, but unfortunately only works at a maximum 1080p FHD resolution.\n\nIf you travel frequently or use public transportation and need to take this laptop with you on a daily basis, it may be a bit on the heavy side, so for me it is primarily a desktop replacement that you can move around the house and occasionally travel with.  The 360 degrees hinge makes this a versatile system that can easily switch between laptop modem, to tent to tablet mode that automatically disables the keyboard and touchpad.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this to a friend as a productivity desktop replacement, content creator/editor and occasional light gaming system.",

I was fine with the 16 inch screen on thus because it is touch, and the 2 in 1 feature is nice, but I don't use my others much like that. It is built well, metal top and bottom and much more sturdy than my old device, weight wise, about the same.  The screen is crisp colors are good, says hdr enabled, and touch is very responsive.  The touchpad works ok with this, like my old one, but 95% of the time i use an external mouse (bluetooth and usb dongle, i have tried both with this so far, both work well, quick pairing) This has ample usb and usb-c connections, and an SD card Reader. I will miss the built in optical drive, I like being able to watch movies and not lug an external drive either me, I will have to now (as well as purchase dvd software).  Unfortunately that's the way all systems I tried to build are.   The keyboard layout us good, the backlight helps in the evenings typing.  The video camera and mic work well for video conferencing, and the sound us quite adequate.  This unit is mainly used for word processing, and simple games (solitare, slots, roblox) occasionally, and is more than enough. It also gets a ton of internet time.  So far it easily makes it through 8 hours of intermittent use during a workday, but I have nit ran it completely dead, only to about 20%. It has very adequate ram (16gb) and storage (1tb ssd).  I have not experienced bog, or lag on anything yet. The start up is very quick.   It also runs fairly cool on the lap when used like that.  It almost a twin for the one I'm replacing, just 6 years newer, ssd instead of standard hard drive, and no optical drive. My old one has Intel optane memory that made it start faster than standard laptops of the time, now this computer is all ssd and same fast access.  For a solid daily use computer for non gaming, this solidly checks all the boxes and a fair value.  I have to give it a solid 5 stars, nothing on it that I would deduct stars for on it\u2019s part. I hope the durability is a bit better than my old one. I\u2019v changed the battery twice (once just after warranty ran out at 3.5 years, and once about a year ago), and the keys are sticking in the asdf line of keys. Time will tell.",

      "body": "At home, or in the office, most people will never push the Dell - Inspiron 16 7640 hard enough to demonstrate the full power it has available.  With a respectable (but not \u201cGaming Fast) 16\u201d FHD touch display with Webcam, it\u2019s certainly capable of running Engineering or Architectural Design Programs like SolidWorks or Revit. This computer will give you years of use. If the Feature details below are too technical, you can just be sure they are VERY impressive especially for a Laptop.\n\nFeatures:\n- Core Ultra 7 155H CPU\n- 16\u201d Touch Display with Intel ARC Graphics, Built-in microphone, and Web-cam\n- Flexible Hinge allows the screen and keypad to be bent backwards so the 7640 can be used like a flat tablet, or the screen can be propped up securely on a surface like an airplane tray.\n- 16 Gb of Dual Channel, DDR5 6400MHz RAM (soldered in place, therefore not expandable)\n- 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe Solid State Drive (very compact, very fast, relatively cool running), (can be replaced by up to a 2 TB drive)\n- Wireless AX+ Bluetooth\n- 1 SD Card Reader Slot\n- 2 USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A Ports\n- 1 Thunderbolt 4 Port (with DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery)\n- 1 HDMI 1.4 Port\n- Charges through a standard USB 3 port rather than a proprietary dedicated port.\n- Backlit Keyboard.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- The NVMe hard drive gives fast bootup and transition speeds between programs.  Its 1 TB size can be doubled with a screw-driver by most DIY users.\n\n- The Backwards-Bending hinge makes the Dell 7640 good for small sales presentations or training sessions.\n\n- The touchscreen makes it a good tablet-device too.\n\n- Considering its power, it\u2019s thin and light.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- RAM is not upgradable.\n\n- Because I travel on business a lot, I turn the laptop on when I have even a short time to do some work between flights.  For some reason Dell chose on this 7640 not to include a camera good enough to enable Windows-Hello facial recognition.  This means that instead of coming to life as soon as you open the laptop and show it your face, you have to go through the tedious manual password typing startup or fumbling for the fingerprint reader.\n\n- To save battery on my other laptops, I like the option of being able to hit the function keys to turn the screen fully dark when I have to take a short break.  For some reason, the Dell designers decided to only let you adjust the screen dimmer, but never fully off.\n\nConclusion:\nAgain, this laptop is not designed for AAA gaming performance, but if you just type emails and cruise the internet, or work with graphic applications like SolidWorks Engineering, Revit or Photoshop that don\u2019t require blazing response times, then this one deserves your serious consideration.",

No issues with connection so far.\nWhat impresses the most so far is the battery life.

Because it is a touch screen, sometimes my big fat fingers have issues clicking the right buttons if the screen is too small.  Its also decently powerful and can handle quite a bit in photoshop and elements.  I was able to do quite a bit in both programs without running into any issues or feeling like the computer dragged too much.\n\nI did try to game on it a bit and it works fine for any web based games, lighter games like minecraft, as well as older games like StarCraft 2.  Putting on newer stuff worked too, but the image settings were a bit lower.  That\u2019s to be expected since it doesn\u2019t have the best graphics chips in it.  I wouldn\u2019t use this for a full on gaming computer, but if you took it to college and wanted to do some light gaming on it, it  would work great.\n\nThe speakers were a bit disappointing as I expected a bit better from the specs.  Its still really pretty good and clear, but the max volume wasn\u2019t as loud as I expected.  Since I use headphones most of the time, this isn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nInstall was also surprisingly easy.  I\u2019ve been really annoyed recently with the bloatware and required user accounts just to get your computer running.  This still had all of that, but it felt like it didn\u2019t try so hard to prevent you from skipping or working around it.\n\nI do really like the fingerprint scanner, since for work or school the computer is getting closed and logged into a lot and its just so much faster and easier.  It also hast the built in webcam cover so you can be sure that even if something happened and your camera gets turned on by accident, you know it won\u2019t show anything embarrassing.  This is a real  must have for me to send with a college kid who may have a one bedroom apartment where they change clothes in view of the computer.\n\nI did notice that it takes quite a bit more power than I expected.  The charger is 100w USBc Charger while other standard USBc chargers I have are 60w.  In fact my stand alone higher watt USBc charging station is only 90w since that was enough for nearly every laptop that had charging by USBc.  Most other laptops I have that need more than 90w have a non-USB charger.  If you plug in anything less than 100w into it, even if you have nearly full power, this computer will do the stupid Dell \u201cwe\u2019re slowing everything down to protect you and your computer, but really we\u2019re trying to force you to buy our genuine more expensive replacement charger\u201d scam.  Its annoying, but it will actually charge off of a 90w or 60w charger.  So if you don\u2019t need the power or speed you can just run it and let it slow charge while plugged into a lower watt charger, or in if you really need the speed you can let it charge at a slow rate until you have enough to work for a while, then  you can unplug it and run at full speed off battery power, rinse and repeat as necessary.  Annoying, but still not as bad as a lighting port.\n\nIt did work fine with my dell docking station, even though it is older and designed for lower powered UCBc laptops, but I think technically the power block for the station is 120w so if you have a dock you should be ok with it even if its a bit older.\n\nOverall this is a great college or work computer.  I would recommend this for pretty much anyone but someone looking for a serious gaming machine.",

The large, beautiful screen is completely worth the extra size and weight in my opinion. I also have a portable monitor that I carry with me that\u2019s just slightly smaller than the laptop. But with that addition, I have a fully functional home office setup with plenty of screen real-estate wherever I go.\nThe battery life has been great so far, although most of the time I use it while plugged in. The built-in speakers sound really good and are plenty loud when you need to turn up the volume. The keyboard isn\u2019t anything special, but I found it to be easy to use. The track pad space is pretty large, so I did find myself accidentally touching it sometimes while typing.

It has a USB-A port and a regular HDMI port on the left side. Then on the right side, there\u2019s another USB-A port, headphone jack, and an SD card reader slot. \nI have only one nitpicky complaint about the laptop, and that\u2019s how the screen/lid is hinged. When it\u2019s sitting flat and you open the screen up to a good viewing angle, it lifts the back of the laptop off the surface slightly. It doesn\u2019t really cause any problem, but it just felt weird until I got used to it. Actually, maybe it\u2019s even a good thing for improving air flow underneath for cooling. At the end of the day, though, I love everything else about this laptop and highly recommend it.",

      "body": "Middle of the road laptops are a dime a dozen in this world and this is where this Dell falls.   \n\nPROS\n\nThis is a touch screen that has a folding display which allows it to convert into something like a very big tablet or you can set to have just the foldable screen showing without the keyboard showing.\n\nBacklit keyboard.\n\nNice display.\n\nCONS\n\nTouchpad is way to sensitive and was constantly doing things that I never wanted.   Typically on laptops these days with such flaky touchpads, I just get a mouse to prevent accidental inputs.   16 gigs of ram.\n\nOVERALL\n\nGeekbench 6 GPU score:   OpenGL 34912\nGeekbench 6 CPU score:   Single Core:  2263    Multi Core:  12109\n\nThe computer is average or adequate in its actions for an everyday user.   Body of the laptop construction quality is above average looking and feeling.    Screen is bright and nice size for people with older eyes.    It has an i7 Ultra processor with up to 22 logical processors.    Based on my experience with laptops, this thing didn't feel any more powerful than an i5 or Ryzen 5 laptop.   Perhaps this is hamstrung with the minimal 16 gigs for ram.   I was not impressed with performance.   It was just there and did as it could, but not remarkable in any way.\n\nOne thing that was interesting is that the computer was evidently made 4/09/2024 and that is when the warranty started even though it did get powered on by me for initial boot until 4/24/2024.\n\nHas HDMI out with 2 usb-c / thunderbolt 4 ports (one is the charging port) along with two usb 3 ports.   \n\nI downgraded this laptop because it appears to not be ram upgradeable - what you buy is what you get.",

      "title": "Great everyday laptop!",
      "body": "I've been using this 2 in 1 laptop for the past week and it is a great everyday computer. It's got a nice, sleek look with the metal chassis that shows as silver in most light, but you get a glance of ice blue at different angles. It's pretty cool and makes the computer feel more premium. The speaker grills border the sides of the keyboard and produce decent sound considering the size and limitations.\n\nScreen size is exactly what I wanted to replace a 6+yr old 17\" 2 in 1. Anytime you get above 15\" screens, weight starts to become more of a factor. For a 16\" laptop, this Dell is relatively light weight, which is impressive considering the metal body. The screen is crisp and works well in any light. In my use the computer never got excessively hot or loud from fans running. It has 2 USB C; 2 USB A; 1 HDMI; 1 SD card slot and a headphone jack. The charging cable is USB C, so be aware that one of the 2 ports will be needed for power during longer sessions. \n\nOverall, the only thing I wish this laptop had is a full number keypad. If the speakers were placed elsewhere, I think there's enough room for it. Otherwise, this is a really nice option for work, school or casual users who just want to do basic email, watch videos, run MS Office, or surf the web.",
