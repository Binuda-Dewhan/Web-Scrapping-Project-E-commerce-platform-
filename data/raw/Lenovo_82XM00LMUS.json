I personally have a hp Victus i7 and was impressed with the performance of this IdeaPad. The uncertainty of tarrifs made us get this. Her 2020 i5 10th gen IdeaPad has had zero issues, on original install, and boots from button to log on in 27 seconds, But also only has 720p,12gb Ram and 256gb ssd. So this was still a significant upgrade. We will give the old one to her mom to continue using. Lenovo makes solid products.",

I recently purchased a Lenovo laptop, and so far, it\u2019s been a solid investment.\n\nThe setup was simple and straightforward, and I appreciate how user-friendly the interface is. It runs smoothly even with multiple tabs open\u2014whether I\u2019m toggling between Google Classroom, PowerPoint, or student data portals. The keyboard is comfortable for long stretches of typing, and the battery life easily gets me through the school day without needing a charge.\n\nOne of the things I like most is its durability. I carry it back and forth between home and school, and it\u2019s held up really well. It\u2019s not overly heavy, which is a bonus when you\u2019re already carrying papers, a lunch bag, and everything else that comes with the job.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the flashiest device on the market, it gets the job done efficiently\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what I need. If you\u2019re a fellow educator looking for a dependable, budget-friendly laptop that can keep up with the demands of teaching, I\u2019d definitely recommend checking out Lenovo",

      "body": "I\u2019ve been using the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U for a little while now, and overall, I\u2019m pretty happy with it. For the price, it feels like a solid deal especially with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD packed into a slim and light chassis. The Arctic Grey color looks clean and modern too.\n\nPerformance-wise, it handles multitasking easily. I can run several tabs, documents, and apps without any slowdown, and it stays pretty quiet while doing it. The Ryzen 7 gives it a nice boost in speed definitely not sluggish like cheaper laptops I\u2019ve used in the past.\n\nThe touchscreen is a nice bonus. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d use it much, but it\u2019s surprisingly handy for scrolling and quick taps when I don\u2019t feel like using the trackpad. The display itself is Full HD and clear, though the brightness could be better if you\u2019re working in a really sunny room.\n\nBattery life is decent but not amazing. I get through most of the day on a single charge, but if I\u2019m doing more intensive tasks, I\u2019ll need to plug it in sooner.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I\u2019d say the speakers are just average and the build is more plastic-y than premium, but again for the price point, you can\u2019t expect a MacBook build quality.\n\nBottom line: It\u2019s fast, reliable, and has great specs for what I paid. It\u2019s a great everyday laptop for work, school, or casual use. If you\u2019re not super picky about ultra-bright displays or high-end materials, this is a great buy.",

The 512GB SSD is just enough for basic programs, projects. etc. 16GB of RAM is above average but the bloat and AI in Windows will still see you at 40-50% usage with a web browser running. The AMD Ryzen 5825U is just enough power for basic Lightroom editing while maintaining good battery life. My only gripe is the industry average build quality. Don't lift it with one hand on the bottom near the keypad because it will start clicking things on your screen since the frame flexes.

The AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor delivers blazing-fast performance \u2014 perfect for multitasking, productivity work, and even light creative tasks like photo editing.\n\nThe 16GB RAM ensures smooth performance with multiple applications open, and the 512GB SSD offers ample storage with lightning-fast boot and load times. The Full HD touchscreen is responsive and bright, with good color reproduction and viewing angles \u2014 great for both work and media consumption.\n\nBuild quality is solid and the Arctic Grey finish gives it a sleek, professional look. The laptop is also relatively lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around for work or school. Battery life is impressive, comfortably lasting through a full day of moderate use.\n\nOverall, the IdeaPad Slim 3 offers premium performance at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended for students, professionals, or anyone looking for a reliable and capable everyday laptop.",

No scratches, perfect condition, everything works flawlessly right out of the box.\n\nPerformance-wise, it\u2019s smooth and fast for everyday use,web browsing, Zoom meetings, streaming, and working in Microsoft Office. It boots up quickly, and the display is clear and easy on the eyes. The keyboard feels great for typing, and it\u2019s light enough to carry around all day.\n\nBattery life easily lasts me around 6 hours with regular use. The only minor limitation is the 8\u202fGB of soldered RAM, it\u2019s fine for regular multitasking, but not ideal for heavy-duty gaming or advanced editing.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this laptop,especially if you can grab an open-box deal like I did.

He reminded me as a Total Rewards member I had a 60 Day return policy. There was absolutely no pressure. At the last minute I decided to buy. So far it is exactly what I need a very basic reliable computer that has been compared to a Toyota Corolla which is my car LOL\n\nAnd when there was a second sale a week later I was able to get the lower price and the difference was credit back to my card.

The design is simple but looks great in Arctic Grey. It's slim and lightweight, so I\u2019ve been able to easily carry it around without feeling weighed down.\n\nThe 15.6\" Full HD touchscreen is responsive, and I\u2019ve found it really handy for quick navigation. The screen looks sharp, but the viewing angles aren\u2019t the best \u2014 if you're sitting off to the side, the colors do fade a little.\n\nPerformance-wise, the AMD Ryzen 7 and 16GB of RAM make multitasking super smooth. I can have several tabs open, watch videos, and use office apps all at once without any lag. The 512GB SSD is a nice touch too; it boots up quickly and has plenty of space for everything I need.\n\nThe keyboard is comfortable to type on, though the key travel could be a little better. I do a lot of typing, and I\u2019m pretty happy with it overall. The trackpad works well too \u2014 it\u2019s responsive and supports multi-finger gestures, which is nice.\n\nBattery life is decent \u2014 I usually get about 7 hours of use, which is fine for most of my workday. Heavy tasks like streaming or video editing will drain it faster, but for general use, it holds up well. Plus, the fast charging feature is super handy when I need a quick boost.\n\nIf you're looking for a laptop that\u2019s good for browsing, working, or watching shows, this one definitely delivers. It\u2019s not built for heavy gaming or video editing, but for my day-to-day use, it\u2019s been perfect.
