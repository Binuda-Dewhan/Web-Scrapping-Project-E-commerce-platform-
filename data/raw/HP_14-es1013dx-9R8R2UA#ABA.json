The processor and RAM are enough for what she does with it, able to handle all the programs she uses at school and good enough for light gaming (World of Warcraft, Minecraft, etc.) but not sure if it would be able to handle anything more demanding like a AAA title since it doesn't have a separate GPU.

Didnt even have it a full year of usage. The system hardware failed after a little while. With blinking caps lock.  Didnt use it daily, didnt drop it, it had no type of physical damage caused by me. The issues are internal from the faulty system they set up and sent out to me. The customer service is AWFUL. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER AT ALL. I\u2019m so disappointed and wish I never brought it. I can either be out $600 or fight this. I\u2019m a fighter so I\u2019ll be seeking legalities to get my money back for sure.",
