The battery doesnt last as long as my macbook but i will compromised for the full keyboard and screen size. I love this screen size and its 16:9 aspect ratio for fitting many windows side by side. I tried to play a game \u201cFae Farm\u201d and it got really hot, fans were off the chain and drained my battery from 100% to 80% within 30 min.

      "title": "This notebook has good bones...",
      "body": "This silver HP15 notebook has a lot of potential (and good bones as I say).  It's based on Intel's i7 1355U CPU, 10 Cores and 12 Threads (2 Performance Cores w/4 Threads, running from 1.7 GHz to 5.0 GHz Turbo and 8 Efficient Cores w/8 Threads running from 1.2 GHz to 3.7 GHz Turbo). Its multi thread rating is 14590 and single thread rating is 3471. Typically consuming 15W but peaking at 55w.  It's a power efficient processor that has been popular in mid to high-end notebooks.  It weighs 3.5 pounds.  With a 1920x1080 HD touch screen. This HP15 does not have a dedicated GPU, instead offering Intel's iRISxe GPU.  IT also does not have a backlit keyboard (which I think a notebook in this price range should have). It also does not have an Ethernet port or a SDcard reader.  It has two USB 3.0 USB-A ports and one 3.0 USB-C port and 1 HDMI 1.4 port (w/HDR). It has a headphone/mic jack.  It supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 (not 5.4). It has a 720P camera with a physical camera shutter (Also I think the camera should be 1080P at this price).  It integrates Microsoft Copilot with a Copilot key. And you can quickly mute the microphone with the F6 key (love this feature).  The USB ports are all limited to 5Gbps, not 10 w/USB 3.1 or 20 w/USB 3.1 v2, it does not support outputting to a USB monitor via the USB-C port.  It has a nice trackpad. The back of the monitor is a silver plastic as is the keyboard base, the bottom of the computer is a lighter weight gray plastic.  The back can easily be removed by removing 4 screws (good/easy).\n\nIntel's iRISxe GPU is a big improvement over older Intel integrated graphics processors, it can handle light gaming at lower settings. It is fine for basic video editing and creative tasks and for browsing the internet.  It's energy efficient; it is not suitable for high-end gaming. It should get about 7 hours of usage on battery power.  It comes with a unremarkable Samsung Gen 4x4 PM9C1 SSD; spec'd to have max seq writes at 4950 MBs and reads at 2500 MBs.  It supports DDR4 memory 3200 MT/s. It comes with 16GB (2x8GB SODIMMs).  The SSD and Memory are removable/replaceable.  This is why I acquired this notebook; to upgrade it.\n\nI did the initial set up and upgrades with the base hardware.  Windows Home 11 requires you to have a Microsoft account to log into. I went through a HP BIOS upgrade and needed at least 3 \"updates\" to get all of the Microsoft updates.\n\nI'm replacing the SSD with a much faster 2TB Orico SSD rated at 7400 seq reads and 7000 seq writes, of which I got 7032 reads and 6348 writes. And I will upgrade the memory to 64GB with G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4 (2x32GB) 3200 MT/s CL22.  To clone the SSD you must disable Windows 11 BitLocker (Encryption), with Windows 11 Home this is slightly more complicated but doable.  The Samsung SSD tested out at 4440 reads and 2105 writes (CrystalDiskMark8).  This is about 30% slower than the Orico SSD.  Both my memory and SSD upgrades went smoothly.\n\nThe notebook runs a little warm, you can feel that the left side of the keyboard and palmrest is warmer than the right side. But it has a very nice screen and it's FAST and only 3/4\" thick. The keyboard is just ok, there is a little bit of give, and the island keys have a cheap plastic feel to them, with a so-so key travel (And I've become used to having a backlit keyboard).  With the faster SSD and some configuration changes browsing the internet with either Edge or Chrome (via WiFi 6) was very fast.  I did some audio editing and it was smooth and fast.  The speakers are adequate.  I usually edit with a BT connection or using headphones/earbuds, both of these worked very well.  I do astrophotography where I stack hundreds of night photos.  This is why I needed more memory.  The application I use is not so GPU intensive as it is memory intensive. Loading and comparing hundreds of images can only be done efficiently with lots of memory.  This computer's i7 processor handles this pretty efficiently.  I processed a stack of about 100 images in just over 2 minutes 40 seconds.  My older notebook (2 years old (i7 w/48Gb memory)) took just over 5 minutes.  So this notebook, as upgraded, will be faster; partially because SSDs have gotten faster.  When Gen5 SSD's and notebooks come down in price I'll likely upgrade again.  But for now this is not a bad compromise (once upgraded).",

      "title": "Large screen, lightweight, fast",
      "body": "This is my first HP laptop with a touchscreen. The laptop weighs only about 3.5 lbs thanks to its all plastic chassis; the 45 Watt charger adds another half pound of weight when travelling. The laptop is around 3/4\" thick with a very slight taper from back to front. I like this form factor because it's got a large screen but doesn't feel heavy or bulky. \n\nThis build comes with a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U processor that has a 1.7 GHz base clock with 5GHz max boost, 16GB of 3200 MHz DDR4 RAM pre-installed across two 8GB sticks, and 512GB NVMe Gen 4 m.2 SSD. Note that 16GB is the advertised maximum RAM capacity for this model and it cannot be upgraded further, however, the SSD can be replaced with a larger capacity if desired by removing four small screws on the bottom and popping off the base panel. The power port and a USB-A 3.0 port are at its right-side back corner, and a second USB-A 3.0, as well as HDMI 1.4 out, USB-C 3.0, and combo mic/headphone port are on its left side.\n\nThe IPS display is glossy without the matte haze of a glare filter but still rejects reflections well. The max resolution is 1920x1080p FHD with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is decently bright at 300 nits but only has 8-bit color covering 45% of the NTSC color gamut (65% sRGB) which may not be detailed or accurate enough for some creators and digital artists. As I'm more accustomed to 100% sRGB displays, the colors look slightly dull and under saturated to my eye. Clarity is very good though with crisp, easy-to-read onscreen text. The display is powered by Intel's Iris Xe which is an entry-level integrated graphics suitable for casual gaming. Connectivity-wise it supports WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, however, there is no Ethernet port.\n\nAt the top of the screen is a 720p integrated webcam with dual-array microphone. The image quality of the camera is serviceable for virtual meetings and live streaming but tends to be slightly grainy with a soft focus even in the best lighting conditions. It has a status LED so you know when it's on and a sliding privacy cover. However, it isn't compatible with Windows Hello facial recognition for login.\n\nThe touch features work fine and respond to swipes and multi-finger gestures like pinch-to-zoom. I was also impressed with how oleophobic the glass is, keeping it relatively fingerprint and smudge free. The panel does not, however, fold 360 degrees flat for use as a \"tablet\" and stops around 120 degrees open. The screen's hinge gives slightly when the screen is touched or tapped which makes using it somewhat awkward. Since the large 5\"x3\" mouse trackpad is closer to the keyboard, I tend to use it more often out of habit and convenience. \n\nThe keyboard is full-size and includes a number pad on the right-hand side. The up/down directional arrow keys are only half-keys, however, which takes a bit of getting used to and may impact one's gaming experience. While the exterior of the laptop feels pretty solid, there is a bit of flex to the keyboard deck and a sense of hollowness when typing. The keys are also fairly clicky with a high actuation force and rough plastic-y feel which is different from the soft-touch mushiness that I'm used to in laptops. The keyboard's top row consists of action keys by default, like emoji menu, brightness, volume, and playback controls, while F-functions are secondary. There's a dedicated key for launching HP's system control and configuration apps, Omen Gaming Hub and/or myHP, as well as Window's AI assistant, co-pilot.\n\nThe power, caps lock, and speaker/mic mute keys all have status LEDs built-in so you know when they are toggled on. One of the things that I found really impressive was the sound quality of the downward-facing stereo speakers. They are loud with a bright, rich sound that resonates throughout the entire keyboard deck with only the slightest hint of tinny boxiness and distortion at max volume. The fans are also surprisingly quiet and don't compete with the speakers making this laptop a good fit for consuming music and streaming video content.\n\nThe battery charges quickly, in only a couple hours, and its status LED will turn from orange to white when fully charged. While it\u2019s rated to last up to nearly 8 hours on battery, I found that on max brightness I\u2019m usually able to only get around 2-3 hours of mixed use from it (gaming, web browsing, word processing, and listening to music at medium volume). To extend the battery life to its max, you'll need to enable Eco settings and reduce screen brightness, etc. \n\nOverall, this laptop is a decent mid-level, general use laptop that is lightweight, quiet, and fast while offering a large screen. While color accuracy isn\u2019t top tier and only the SSD can be upgraded, its specs are good enough to handle games like Warframe and Path of Exile at medium graphics, and it performs well for everyday tasks like web browsing and consuming media.",

      "title": "Students and casual users may want to take a look.",
      "body": "The design of this laptop is functional and suitable for both school and work scenarios. The plastic build contributes to its light weight, although it feels less sturdy. The top cannot be lifted with one hand and tends to wobble during use. The screen features thin bezels but has a thicker chin. It includes a camera with a security slider and microphone holes at the top. \n\nThe laptop is equipped with a few ports: HDMI 2.1, two USB-A, and one USB-C (which does not support Thunderbolt 4, charging, or video output) but offers super-speed capabilities. \n\nThe full-size keyboard may feel slightly cramped, requiring an adjustment period. The keys have good travel and spring, though they may feel less durable. There is no backlight, which may affect typing in low light conditions. The trackpad is highly responsive and smooth, with satisfying springboard-style clicking. \n\nThe 1080p-60Hz display performs adequately in most situations. However, at 300 nits, the brightness is insufficient for well-lit environments, and the glossy screen may be problematic. Color accuracy is limited, making it unsuitable for serious photo or video editing. \n\nFor security, this laptop does not support face or fingerprint Windows Hello.  \n\nPerformance is adequate for a mid-range laptop. The i7-1355U processor handles regular productivity tasks, content consumption, and web browsing efficiently, supported by 16GB of RAM allowing multiple apps and tabs to run simultaneously. The laptop struggles with more demanding tasks such as advanced content creation and gaming. While there is no overheating, the fans activate frequently and can be loud. A 512GB SSD is enough space for most users. The AI feature is there for those like me who are getting into it. The 720p camera and microphone work well enough for most video calls, but are not very good.\n\nThe speakers provide clear sound without strong bass, and the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone jack is practical for users who prefer wired headsets. \n\nThe battery life extends through a full workday and often longer. The power brick is compact but uses a proprietary plug instead of USB-C. \n\nOverall, this laptop is a viable option for students or users seeking a budget-friendly device despite some limitations.",

      "body": "My business is IT \u2013 so I see all kinds of laptops, desktops, all-in-ones everyday day.  Today I received the HP - 15.6\" Full HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Natural Silver, Model:15-fd0127dx and gave it a run.\n\nSetup was a breeze \u2013 like most Windows PCs today.  No glitches or issues right out of the box.  \n\nThe initial impression is that it\u2019s a clean-looking machine, light with a small 45 watt charger.  Weighs in at less than 4 lbs total including charger.  HOWEVER, the first thing that caught my eye is the old-style round plug charger.  I just can\u2019t figure out why manufacturers don\u2019t just leverage the more modern USB-C charging that many of today\u2019s laptops already have built in.  Can it really save you that much money?  HP \u2013 if you\u2019re reading this \u2013 we\u2019d love an explanation!  That took 1 Star off the review immediately.\n\nNext, once setup, I began to surf the web a bit and type a few documents.  In fact, I\u2019m typing this review on the very device \u2013 and I\u2019m notice a bit of funkiness with the keyboard.  I guess it just doesn\u2019t really feel solid to me as it gives in a little bit when typing.  Also has a very plastic-like feel and click to the keyboard.  May not bother you \u2013 but I notice it.\n\nThe screen is very nice \u2013 although not 4k quality, it will suffice for most business and productivity use cases \u2013 as this is NOT a gaming laptop.  It folds out to about 120 degrees, feels solid when using the touchscreen (doesn\u2019t seem to move if you have light fingers) and produces nice colors and clarity.\nThis model has a large touchpad that works well and feels responsive.  It supports multi-finger gestures, and I feel it is suited to this mid-range laptop style.\n\nOn all my machines, I use a Passmark Performance Test tool to compare the main components.  Overall \u2013 this machine produces decent CPU test scores and great SSD hard disk scores (see attached screenshots).  It lacks a dedicated GPU (which is why this isn\u2019t a gaming rig) but it will work perfectly well for everyday surfing, streaming and office work.\n\nLack of more USB-C ports lost this machine another star in my rating \u2013 you only have 1.  You have two other USB-A ports available \u2013 do don\u2019t plan to plug lots or peripherals into this laptop unless you have a USB-C dock.\n\nOverall \u2013 it\u2019s a fine machine for everyday use, just a bit on the lower side for specs and performance.",

      "body": "When my HP Model 15-fd0127dx laptop arrived, you could immediately tell that it was the no-frills, workhorse of a computer that I expected.  With no fancy model names and no extravagant packaging, this 15.6 diagonal touch-screened, lightweight 3.52 lbs, thin 0.73\" thick laptop meets the needs of those who are looking for a moderately priced but powerful work / school computer.  \n\nThis laptop with its 13th Generation Intel Core i7-1355U high power efficiency 15W low voltage mobile processor with Intel IRIS Xe Graphics at 1300 MHz onboard, 12MB of L3 Cache, 16 GB of DDR4 3200 MHz of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage was designed to hit the latest sweetspot between price and performance and I think this machine does this well.  The 1920 x 1080 dpi 15.6\" IPS LED touchscreen display at 300 NITs brightness provides a clear and pleasant user experience whether viewing spreadsheets, drawing in 3D CAD programs, surfing the Web or playing casual games. \n\nI am pleased that HP provided plenty of useful ports on this model.  There is a 45W AC pin power port, (2) 3.0 SS USB A ports, (1) 3.0 SS USB C port and (1) 1.4b HDMI port. There is also a headphone and microphone combo port on the right.  \n\nThe keyboard has a large, clear font and has a much desired (by workers and students)10-key numerical input. \n\nThere is no Ethernet port.  This HP has WiFi 6.\n\nThere is a sufficient 720p front facing video camera that can be placed in privacy mode with the privacy hood.  Paired with the camera are the built-in HD Audio microphone and Stereo speakers, which make for good Zoom meetings or other connected encounters. \n\nThe battery life is rated at up to 7 and 3/4 hours, but I haven't tested this out, since I usually leave my laptops plugged into an outlet.\n\nAll-in-all this HP 15-fd0127dx model has everything I need for most work and casual play.  I wouldn't use it for accurate color reproduction for movies or photos, and I wouldn't use it for heavy duty online gaming, but it will do just about anything else that you can throw at it and do it well.",

The display is also a touchscreen that is both accurate and responsive.\n\nBattery:\nThis is where I had to remove a star. The battery life is rated at 7 hours and 45 minutes according to the manual, but after testing, I still haven't been able to hit that estimate. I'm sure I could tweak some power settings, but in 2025, I find it completely unacceptable that a laptop in this price range can\u2019t last more than seven hours during regular use with stock settings out of the box. Again, I could optimize the system to extend battery life, but it would be at the cost of performance.\n\nOverall Specs:\nThis HP, paired with the i7-1355U and 16GB of RAM, is snappy and perfectly capable of handling everyday browsing, streaming, and any other task the average user could throw at it. I have to give HP massive credit when it comes to upgradeability.\n\nI\u2019m more comfortable than most when it comes to computers, and I\u2019ve been known to upgrade my RAM and solid-state drives when the time comes to beef up a system. I was pleased to see that neither of these components is soldered to the motherboard (see photos). I opened up my system so you don't have to, and I had the biggest grin when I saw that not only is this system running dual-channel RAM (two sticks of 8GB), but the M.2 solid-state drive is also easily accessible. This means that years down the road, when your system isn\u2019t as fast as it was out of the box or you run out of storage, any computer technician or DIYer could upgrade this system in minutes. I love seeing manufacturers giving consumers these options\u2026 well done, HP.\n\nPorts:\nUnfortunately, I think most people in the market for this HP would want an SD card reader, and this laptop doesn\u2019t have one. This isn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me, but I know some people still want the convenience of sliding in an SD card without needing an additional dongle. Other than that, this laptop has all the ports you'd expect.\n\nI also don\u2019t love that HP is still using a barrel-jack-style charger. Can we please just adopt USB-C as the standard? The USB-C port on this HP is for data transfer only, which is a missed opportunity.\n\nMy Wish List:\nThis laptop would have been exceptional with a few more creature comforts. There\u2019s no backlight for the keyboard, the charger is proprietary, and the battery life is subpar. Had these features been addressed, this laptop would have been a slam dunk. That being said, if you're a student, casual user, or primarily run basic office applications, this laptop will do everything you need.",

      "title": "Great on paper, but with a few flaws.",
      "body": "On paper, the HP 15-fd0127dx sounds like a standard, good, middle of the range laptop.  It has a colorful and clear 15.6\u201d LED 1080p touchscreen that\u2019s not the brightest at 300 nits, but still fine indoors in normal lighting.  It has an i7 processor, 16 gigs of DDR4 RAM which is more than enough for normal tasks and a bit beyond.  The 512 gig SSD drive is speedy and has enough storage for many.  It doesn\u2019t even weigh 4 pounds so it\u2019s light enough to carry in a backpack.  The speakers (on the bottom) are so-so ok but do the job. So it has all the basics and a bit more.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of glaring issues that I can\u2019t get over. \n\nSetup was pretty standard. Your power comes from a 45w small power brick that unfortunately, isn\u2019t USB-C\u2026 It\u2019s a proprietary plug. You\u2019ll need to reserve a bit of time, as the HP will have a quite large update out of the box once starting up.  Once up and running, things run smoothly with the processor and RAM working together.  Graphics are from an integrated IRIS Xe chip, but it works well enough.  Basic to mid-range games run fine on it, though heavy-hitter games needing higher frame rates might stutter a bit.  Image editing works fine with common editors and small video projects will run along fine as well. \n\nYou have a few ports, but they\u2019re somewhat outdated by 2025 standards.  You have two older USB-A style ports, but today, most items have migrated into USB-C, and there is only one USB-C port on the left along with one USB-A, a HDMI port, and your headphone jack. The other side has another USB-A port and the proprietary power plug-in.  There isn\u2019t a memory card slot.  A 720p web cam sits on top of the monitor which does ok in very good light \u2013 less so in lower light, and lacks in details and color accuracy.  \n\nMicrosoft Copilot is installed with Windows 11, so you can ask Copilot a variety of things to get help with writing, rewording documents, finding solutions to answers and much more.  This is a good feature that now is standard on most Windows laptops and is a good edition to this one.  I find myself using it more than I thought I would.  Use responsibly, as they say. \n\nI do not however, have a good time using the keyboard.  The keyboard on this model feels very flimsy and plasticky. The give of the keys just feels low-quality, as though they are from a much less expensive machine.  While usable, longer typing sessions become uncomfortable.  There is also no back lighting on this keyboard \u2013 unimaginable today, and especially on this level/price of laptop.  You do get a full numeric pad on the right, and standard controls via the function keys for the basics, including one dedicated to inserting emojis in applicable programs. Since having a good quality keyboard is one of the most important parts of a computer however, this is the biggest flaw on this model. There is no fingerprint reader. The trackpad is a decent size and feels fine, allowing for all basic gestures and clicks. The overall build quality of the laptop is good, but again, the keyboard quality drags it down considerably.\n\nThe battery charges reasonably quick and specs say you get just over 7 hours with varied use.  I found it to be more like 5 \u00bd hours of mixed use, at least the way I use it.  Not great but not the worst, but you will have to take the propriety charger brick/cable with you if you plan on using this all day out and about. \n\nUnfortunately, I just can\u2019t recommend the HP 15-fd0127dx.  While the overall specs are fine and it runs ok from an operational standpoint, the plasticky keyboard with no backlighting ruins it for me. Having a propriety power plug in the age where most everything is charging and using USB-C cables is a negative, and not having more than one USB-C port today?  I\u2019m afraid I just can\u2019t give this one my thumbs-up.",

      "title": "Affordable Laptop For Everyday Use",
      "body": "For those who require a dependable machine for both business and enjoyment, this laptop is a great fit since it balances portability and performance. This is my view of what this laptop provides,The machine has a professional yet contemporary look from its elegant, natural silver finish. For a laptop in this price category, the construction quality seems strong and the casing feels to be minimally flexible. Particularly for individuals who would want touch interactions or occasionally use the device in tablet mode, the touch screen adds a degree of ease. \n\nThough it's not the brightest panel available, the 15.6-inch Full HD touch screen is vivid and shows good color reproduction. Regarding regular productivity chores, streaming, and casual gaming, the display excels. On professional front the photo or video editing, you may feel the color accuracy and brightness deficient when compared to more upscale versions. Driven by its DDR4 16GB of RAM and 13TH Gen Intel Core i7 processor, this laptop easily manages most of the multitasking. From running several browser tabs to working with video editing tools, the performance is seamless. Quick boot times and speedy application launches guaranteed by the inbuilt 512 SSD storage greatly improve your experience. \n\nThough it can manage difficult jobs, this is a U-series chip, which means it's intended for efficiency rather than raw power, hence performance-wise it's not on par with H-series chips. The battery life of this device is among the usual points of contention. For those wanting a full day's work without a charger, it falls short even if it's sufficient for moderate use roughly 4\u20135 hours. Though it's a trade-off for the power it packs, if you travel frequently this is something to take into account. Crucially for productivity, the keyboard offers a good travel and comfortable typing experience. Though it's not a deal-breaker, the touchpad might use a little more responsiveness even if it is functionally sound. \n\nThe laptop has a good range of connectors, including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and charge port which supports charging, screen output, and data transmission and Headphone Jack, nearly non-existent in present market. For connectivity particularly for people who utilize docking stations or must connect several peripherals, this is a major advantage. The laptop can warm under severe use, and the fans may grow somewhat noisy. For most users, this won't be a daily concern, for places where silence is required, this isn't ideal. \n\nBased on my usage i can confidently say the HP 15-fd0127 presents outstanding value. Though it's not the least expensive choice, it's fairly priced for what you get a strong processor, lots of RAM, and a touch screen. For the typical user, this laptop checks several criteria the trade-offs are in battery life and maybe display quality for creative workers. This laptop is a well-rounded one that performs for its class really brilliantly. For professionals, students, or anybody else depending on a consistent machine for regular computing chores with sporadic heavy lifting, it's perfect. Although it has several drawbacks, especially with regard to battery life and screen quality for professional work, its benefits in performance, build quality, and connectivity make it a good option for anyone trying to strike a mix between cost and competence. Should you be able to live with its concessions, this laptop will be useful for many years.",

The back of the laptop is made of plastic but the build is sturdy and has very little flex. Build quality is very good. All the seams are tight.\nFor 15-inch laptop, this laptop is not heavy at all. Can easily be used as a travel laptop.\n\nThis laptop is also very speedy. Boot up very fast like just 13 seconds.\nEvery application or game I throw at it run fast and smooth. I am surprised that the integrated graphics by intel called iRIS xe can run games like Need for Speed smoothly. Playing Fortnite though is a bit too much but still playable with correct setting.\nBrowsing web or working or typing has no problem but the fan is always running when the power is plugged in. Luckily it is not loud. Running on battery is very quiet. \n\nLaptop this thin will get warm and this laptop does get a bit warm especially during Windows initial update and playing Fortnite but I think it manages quite well.\n\nTyping on the keyboard is comfortable, the keys are well spaced but sounds hollow when pressing down the keys. The only flaw of this laptop is no backlit keyboard! Why? Actually there is another thing I don't like, it requires me to register with email before I can proceed during the initial setup.\n\nThe touch pad is very responsive. No complain there.\n\nThe screen is bright and easy to my eyes. Color is rich but not too intense. \nThe screen Bezel size is acceptable. Touch screen is responsive. \n\nThe stereo speaker is very good, loud and clear.\n\n15-inch laptop is expected to have multiple ports, this laptop has two usb-a and one usb-c. In my opinion one usb-c is not enough.\nIt does have one hdmi port.\n\nThe power adaptor is small and light, easy for traveling. The laptop is charged using 3.5 mm connector, no usb-c charging.",

      "body": "The HP 15-fd0127dx is a VERY solid mid-level budget laptop with specs suitable for all but the most resource-intensive applications such as those dealing with 3D graphics.\n\nThis processor for this laptop is a 13th generation i7-1355U, running at 1700 Mhz with 10 cores. This is a small step up from the Intel 12th Generation Core i7 processor in an earlier version of the 15-fd0000 line, the 15-fd0107dx. The Microsoft PassMark rating for the processor is 16710.6, which is respectable at the 58th percentile. The PassMark ratings for the 16 GB memory and 512 GB SSD are very strong, at the 77th and 82 percentiles. Only the 3D graphics rating was below the 50th percentile (31st), and the overall PassMark rating was exactly at the midpoint, 50th percentile. Overall, a very solid computer at a reasonable price.\n\nI weighed the HP 15-fd0127dx with a postage scale and was surprised that this 15.6\" screen laptop was not much heavier (3 lbs., 9.5 oz) than my 13\" screen HP Spectre (3 lbs., 2 oz.). The Spectre has served me extremely well over the past five years, as have previous HP Envy and Spectre laptops I have owned. In my experience, HP laptops are real winners, which is why I did not hesitate to get the 15-fd0127dx.\n \nThere are a half-dozen features of the 15-fd0127dx I am ambivalent about.\n\n1. The laptop uses a Chicony a18-135p1b charger with a standard plug rather than charging through a USB-C port like my Spectre. This frees up a USB port, but also means I am totally dependent on the provided charger. I cannot, for example, use my Anker PD USB charger in a pinch. \n\n2. I like the large keyboard with a number pad, but there is no backlighting.\n \n3. The three USB ports are adequate, but two are A and only one is C; given that C is the new standard, it should have been two Cs and one A. Also, the C USB port is not a Thunderbolt port.\n\n4. The SAMSUNG MZVL8512HELU-00BH1 512 GB SSD will probably be adequate for most users, but I actually replaced the SSD that came with my Spectre with a 1 TB SSD and have filled that drive to just over 512 GB. I will have to either refrain from copying my photos and videos to the new laptop or (more likely) replace the 512 GB drive with a 1 TB drive.\n\n5. The HP 15-fd0127dx includes an HDMI connector, always useful when traveling for connecting the laptop to a large-screen TV in a hotel or Airbnb, but probably unnecessary in day-to-day work at home because the 15.6\" screen is big and beautiful. \n\n6. The HP True Vision HD camera is fine for things like video chat, but it is not IR, which means Windows Hello facial recognition is not available for logging in.\n \nSome users might question why this laptop is made of plastic and not aluminum like the Spectre line and why the hinge does not allow folding back the screen to use in tablet mode. If you want those features, you should buy a more expensive laptop. Honestly, unless you are extremely careless with the laptop, you will not break the hard plastic construction. And using a laptop this big as a tablet does not make much sense. The HP 15-fd0127dx may lack a few features, but that is understandable, given its low price, and I think that budget-minded users will be very happy with the features it does have and its excellent performance. I certainly am.",

Anyone should be happy to use this unless you are one of those picky keyboard people who need it to sound a certain way and click a certain way.\n\nIt has decent brightness but don't go into it thinking about HDR content. If you don't have any vision problems you can get away with leaving the initial display settings alone. If not you might want to set the scale to 150%. Performance from the CPU and the integrated graphics is decent. Was able to play a FPS from 2017 on low settings and it was able to run it at 45fps. \n\nIf full sized keyboards are your thing then you will like this one. 15.6 inch display is pretty good and makes this a good all around use laptop. Unless you need to have the fastest of everything then you are definitely in the wrong space looking at this.\n\nThe battery life is decent and the wifi-6 and Bluetooth are handy. Shouldn't have any connectivity issues using this laptop. The lack of being able to charge using USB-C was probably a bad move. You are stuck using a traditional charger with the barrel plug. The cooling vents at the bottom are good for those new coolers that pull in air and blow directly on the bottom and creates a seal on the bottom of the unit that helps direct the cool air into the laptop.\n\nIf you like a light laptop, you will like this one. Not heavy and very portable. It will fit into any bag.\n\nWould I recommend this to someone? Yes I would. HP has always made a decent product for the average user that as long as you take care of it, it will last a while. A upgrade to a larger drive would probably be in your future unless you are going to use a external drive which I would recommend.",

      "title": "Simplistic at home and work device",
      "body": "This HP 15.6\u201d Touch-Screen Laptop is a solid, mid-tier, laptop for everyday use. Unboxing was quick and out of the box, step one is plugging in the laptop and then you are good to go. The material used to make the laptop is lightweight. This was not expected but for the size of the laptop but it is light at 3.5lbs and very easily moved. The material is smooth and rounded on edges, making a simplistic feel and appearance. This laptop can easily be placed in a backpack or bag to be used on the go, while not over-weighing or fatiguing the carrier. That was probably my biggest complaint about my laptop while in college, was it got heavy! The display is clear and there are no issues viewing work related documents or videos. Having an HD screen has become standard at this point and the laptop does not have an obvious defect in this realm - instead it has the upgrade of being a touch screen device. I have not worked very closely with a touch screen device in the laptop realm before (mainly tablets) and do not think there was any loss of display due to this feature. The touch screen allows for a multi-modal approach at tasking, if while typing, one does not feel like swapping down to the touchpad you can just click on the screen and keep going. My child enjoys being able to click something on the screen and make it happen. The screen is also 15.6 inches, which is a moderate size screen that appears larger than I expected. The keyboard also fit more than I had expected. There is a numeric keypad, which most laptops do not have. When considering this device for work-related activities, this is a game changer if one works with numbers or needs to type them frequently. The keyboard design also has one of my largest complaints (a friend also thought this was odd) - the power button is not in the corner of the keyboard, rather it to the right mid portion of the keyboard where it would have been on the edge of the keyboard if there was not a numeric keypad included. It is like the keyboard was designed, then a keypad added, but overall layout was not considered past that point. This is a minor detail, but caused some confusion in my brain and just does not lay right in my mind. The provided hardware unlocks the potential for a solid everyday/work device. The i7 paired with 16GB RAM provides adequate processing power to be able to run multiple applications at once, switching between documents and tabs without delay or lag. Having a video playing while also working away at a document. I have not attempted to push the device with any advanced editing programs; however, I would not expect them to run at full capabilities. Rather, this device allows for the standard everyday computing without a hiccup. With that, in regards to gaming, simple gaming appears to work (OSRS can run without issue) but the graphics capabilities would be limiting in any significant gaming effort. The 512GB storage is smaller than most devices have lately, but in the setting of work/school focused, this is more than enough to allow for daily tasking and not running out of space. Gaming or photo editing would need more, but once again I would not expect those services from this tier of device/hardware included. The battery life appears to be decent, has not died while unplugged and on the go for an afternoon but I would want to have the charger available if was going to be using all day. Predicting with standard use would last about 5-6 hours based on observation. I believe it is claimed to last about 7 hours, but that would make me nervous to bank on. There is an HDMI display connector, so that if you need to plug in device to display on a TV or projector this is easily completed. Have had no issue with connecting to WiFi using this device. Other worthwhile mentions are that the operating system is Windows 11 and Microsoft Copilot available, this appears to have become standard for most devices at this point.",

This is a everything else laptop. Perfect for work, students and anyone else that wants to be connected to the Internet while still having the processing power to do almost anything else, like surfing the web, checking emails, picture and video editing. Spread sheets and using AI programs etc.\n\nThe specs on this laptop are the minimum anybody should be buying these days, there are cheaper laptops out there for sure, but they have lower specs as well. What you get here is not only quality, but you will be future proofing your investment. \n\nSome features include:\n\nScreen: 15.6 touch-screen FHD\n1080p definition, very crisp very clear, and at 15.6 inches it is a pretty large size screen for a laptop.\n\nProcessor: Intel i7\nA very capable and somewhat high-end processor. Probably the most expensive and best component of this laptop. Very future proof and very capable.\n\n\nRAM: 16 GB SSD\nMore than enough to run pretty much any application, program, or software. Enough RAM to future proof, your investment for a long time. And of course, all this comes in a solid state drive. Or SSD. They run faster, quieter, and more efficient than the old Hard Drives.\n\nMemory: 512 GB\nNot the most memory available, but still decent. You\u2019ll be able to store a few high definition, movies programs and music, but that\u2019s about it, you will most likely run out of memory if you do a lot of downloading. The thing is that you can buy additional memory pretty cheaply these days. \n\nGraphics: Intel Iris Xe\nA very entry-level graphics card. Will only be able to play very simple games, well like I mentioned earlier, this is not a gaming laptop. This graphics card should be good enough to run anything else that\u2019s not considered a video game. For example, little handle basic video editing. Programs and software. \n\nConclusion:\nA very fast, a very capable laptop, has all the connections you need like USB-A, USB-C, HDMI etc. It features Microsoft Copilot, which is an AI program to help you create projects, gives you advice, and overall makes things simpler. Comes with a HD Camera and Microphone, long lasting battery, HP claims it can go for 7hrs and 45 minutes. And Stereo Speakers :)",

Integrated graphics means that games like Fortnite and other light games will run on here just fine, but if you want any more intensive games this isn\u2019t the one for you.  Now for someone like my kid that thinks Fortnite is the best game in the world; it has a full keyboard including a number pad, and good enough specs that I don\u2019t have to worry about any school application he might need.  This could be perfect for a student like that\u2026 besides the inability to write on the screen.  It is a touch screen but doesn\u2019t support pen input and it doesn\u2019t fold all the way over, it is very much a laptop.  So, if you are one to take notes on your laptop that involve handwriting this isn\u2019t the laptop for you either.  But if you type your notes this would be absolutely fine.\nThe build quality leaves a bit to be desired.  The description is that it comes from recycled plastic, and it feels plastic.  It is decently light for it\u2019s size which is nice, but it doesn\u2019t feel solid, the outside easily compresses to the touch, much more than I would prefer.  The keyboard feels mushy compared to other keyboards I\u2019ve used.  It does work and it\u2019s not the worst, but it is far from the best.  \nThe ports selection is okay, it has HDMI, 2 USB As, and a single USB C.  I wish it had a USB C on both sides like the USB A and I wish the USB C was capable of charging the laptop.  It uses a proprietary charger, which can be nice, but I really like it when it can charge via the USB C ports as well, as USB C is much more universal.  This one you must make sure you never forget your laptop charger. \nThe screen is 1080p and decently bright, not amazing or anything to write home about but it gets the job done. \nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid of this laptop if it fits the requirements you need spec wise, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to point anyone towards this laptop. It will get the job done.\n\nPros:\nSpecs are good (i7, 16GB ram, 512GB Hard drive)\nSmooth user experience\nLarge screen \nTouch screen\nFull keyboard with number pad\nCons:\nKeyboard is mushy for typing\nNo USB C charging\nNo pen support\nOutside shell isn\u2019t as stiff as I\u2019d prefer it to be.",

      "body": "There is certainly a lot to like about this HP laptop, but it is clearly a budget laptop that has some compromises.  \n\nFirst the good.  As stated in the description, this laptop is best suited for productivity applications and for that environment it excels.  The Intel i7 processor, while not overly powerful, gets the job done quickly and efficiently at 5ghz speed, and the 16GB RAM means that apps and programs load quickly and can have multiple apps open at once.  That's also good for some very basic gaming, although the graphics processor is pretty basic.\n\nThe 1920x1080 screen is good, but not great.  Detail is crisp, but the screen brightness, at only 300 nits, isn't great for very bright rooms or outside.  \n\n512GB storage capacity is the bare minimum these days.\n\nI do appreciate the fact that this laptop was made from recovered plastic that was recycled.  This is also the reason for the gold rating of the EPEAT tool, which measure the environmental impact of the product.  \n\nThe keyboard is ok.  It feels a bit \"clickety clackity.\"  \n\nNow for the bad, and for me these are deal breakers.  HP really needs to get with the program and stop shipping laptops with a proprietary power supply tip and start using USB-C power supplies.  Who wants to lug around a bulky charger when a simple USB-C charger (with enough watts) will do the job?  The laptop does have one USB-C port, but it is not for charging, only for data.\n\nSecond, battery life is pretty bad.  With the screen at full brightness and streaming a 1080p youtube video, the laptop lasted approximately 4.5 hours before reaching 3% battery and shutting down.  Of course that could be increased somewhat by lowering the screen brightness, but since the maximum brightness isn't all that bright it needs to stay at maximum.",

It claims it can charge from 0-50% in 45 minutes, but I havent had to test that yet because the battery life lasts a solid day of moderate use. \n\n I do plan on upgrading the SSD to 1TB eventually.

The first thing that I did was my son and I built a \u201ccompartment\u201d that houses the laptop and shields it from the dust.  I must say that the best feature that I love about this upgrade is the fact that HP is a great company, I have had several HP computers in the past and I am well pleased w/ them as a company.  But having the use of the touchscreen sure makes it easier when programming/inputing files to the CNC, and especially when it comes time to change the bits.  It used to take a while on my old laptop, now I am done in minutes.  I love the size and the weight of this HP laptop, and the graphics are phenomenal for what I need.  \n\nThe initial setup was simple, I made sure it was fully charged and after an update I was able to connect to our home wi-fi w/ out any issues.

I was looking for something that gives me a 15\" class screen and an i7 processor with 16 GB of RAM and has a decent battery life. I stumbled upon the this HP with the right specs and so far it meets my productivity requirements.\n\nThe processor is an i7-1355U. That's a 13th generation processor with 2 Performance Cores and 8 Efficiency cores. The 2 Performance Cores give double threads and the Efficiency Cores are single threaded, so you get 12 total threads of processing.\n\nThe memory is 16 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM. This is where I was slightly disappointed. DDR4 isn't the newest or fastest. I was also looking this up and it doesn't seem like it's upgradeable. 16 GB is the max for this system.\n\nThe storage is mediocre, 512 GB on an NVMe drive. Having done a quick speed test, it reads in the 3600 MB/sec range. I will likely replace this down the road to a more modern 2 TB version when prices come back down. Or I will have to carry a portable SSD.\n\nBattery life has impressed me. It's rated for just shy of 8 hours. So far in my testing, this is pretty accurate. My gaming PC would last me about 2 hours, it's rather bulky and the power supply is bulky as well. This HP is a breath of fresh air. I can easily carry it around and not have to concern myself with a battery for most of my day. I was also surprised at the charging brick. It's tiny compared to my gaming laptop's charger. This charger is rated for 45 watts while most of the other laptops I've dealt with have had minimum 60 watts. \n\nPorts on the HP laptop on the left side include a USB-A, HDMI, an audio jack and a USB-C. Disappointingly, while the USB-C is rated for superspeed, it isn't rated for power nor display out. For that you would need Thunderbolt and this laptop doesn't support it. I would like to get away from proprietary chargers and have a  more generic USB-C charger like some of my other laptops, but this laptop doesn't support it. On the other side of this HP laptop is a USB-A and the barrel connector for power.\n\nThe display is a 15.6\" multi-touch display. It's a glossy screen with nice colors. Resolution is 1920x1080. It's sharp for FullHD. The brightness seems to be in the 300 nits range. It's powered by Intel Iris Xe onboard graphics. This is entry level graphics, which is fine for productivity, but you really can't expect AAA gaming with ultra settings. \n\nThe trackpad is super smooth and is roughly 3\"x5\" so it's a decent size. They keyboard includes a numpad which I find important when doing productivity work. Although the keys are a little small. One thing I immediately found is that the texture of the keyboard keys are a little more coarse than I'm used to. It hasn't affected my typing ability, it's just something that felt a little off the first time I used it.\n\nThe price is right where I expect an i7 PC to be at. For the price, this laptop might hint at cheaper materials, but under the hood, the specs are giving me confidence that I can throw my productivity apps at it with no problems, and even run a Virtual Machine.",

You get a higher-end Intel mobile chip in the Core i7 1355U which is powerful when you need it (with 10 cores overall, 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores for a total of 12 threads, it's a great multi-tasker) but sips power when you're not asking for much so you still get solid battery life.  The 16GB of DDR4 and 512GB fast NVMe SSD are strong for today should be good into the future as well.  The screen is 15.6\" and FullHD so you have lots of room to work without squinting at tiny text and it does get nice and bright.  It's also very clear for movie watching though the black levels aren't as good as some of the newer screen technologies.  You get a GREAT keyboard with a full number pad and a large trackpad that does seem to support gestures.  Port selection is good though not great with 2xUSB-A, 1xUSB-C and HDMI.  And the laptop is very quiet / near silent even under load which is really nice.\n\nThe included Windows 11 install is pretty standard with just a couple of HP helper apps that don't intrude much and a trial of McAfee that is common on many OEMs these days.  The computer FEELS snappy and is great to use plugged in or unplugged for most tasks.  It zips through office tasks, web browsing, media playback (local or streamed), photo editing and more.  The integrated graphics aren't the best but you can play light / retro games just fine particularly with lower resolutions / lower detail levels.\n\nSo given what you get - a quality laptop that zips through most everything you might want to do (except high end gaming) at a good price - I can highly recommend this HP effort.  Give it a try today!",

      "body": "i7 with a respectable 16 gb of RAM, which is important given the Iris Xe integrated graphics. Xe is much better than previous integrated graphics, but all integrated graphics processors borrow memory (hence the \"integrated\") unlike a dedicated GPU, so your RAM is your big limiting step. \n\nPorts: USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and power jack\nThis is my one and major gripe about this HP laptop. For a laptop with these specs on paper, 15.6\" screen, i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD - this is a slam dunk for a solid productivity laptop, especially with the full size HDMI port. But then, they made the USB-C data transfer only, meaning you can't charge the laptop via the USB-C. In 2025, this makes no sense to me, as every device manufacturer has been consolidating their ports. \n\nTouchscreen matters to some, not to me at all. The OCD in me cringes every time I think about tapping on my screen, and I would personally be wiping off the screen repetitively. But for creative types, or even for simple touch features akin to phones (zoom in/out), touchscreen is a nice quality of life upgrade from using the touchpad. \n\nBattery life is mid, lasting me only about 5 hours using light video play and mostly Word and Excel use unplugged. I get the form factor is slim, limiting the battery capacity, but again, no dedicated GPU so it was a bit disappointing to me.\n\nOverall thoughts: very solid specs for a productivity use laptop, and pleasant surprise that the Iris Xe graphics can handle most of my Steam library. Not being able to use my USB-C cable to charge this laptop and limit the amount of extra stuff I need to carry in my bag was disappointing but not a dealbreaker for me. Worth it for the price",

      "body": "This system does well for my daughter's schoolwork and general usage. Past that, I'm not sure where I would place it in recommendations. While it does have some decent specifications, it falls short in other areas for a system at this price point. \n\nThe screen is indeed great looking with very responsive touch sensitivity with little to no lag. Videos pop in color and the framerates are smooth if using for cloud gaming. \n\nSpeakers are good enough if at home with minimal noise, but past that, mid-level sound with average performance at best. I will note that voices do ring fairly clear. Those frequencies get a nod. \n\nBattery life is slightly below average. On a full charge, with basic, non-demanding usage, I'm getting 3-4.5 hours before needing to charge, and that is on the balanced setting. With anything labor intensive, I'd be pushing 3. While the screen is beautiful, I see no other reason to have such limited power.\n\nRegardless of battery, the performance lives up to the i7. Thus far, I haven't had any slowdowns or crashes and the tasks I have applied have been uninterrupted. Alos the heat dissipation hasn't been an issue. While using in my lap, the comfort level hasn't been an issue.\n\nNo backlit keys. Minor, but a sore spot for my taste on any machine above $500.\n\nCamera is no frills. Top resolution for video is 720P, and still photos is under 1MP. Works for basic calls, but don't look to do any optimized streaming.\n\nThe build of the machine is a mixed bag. The keys have a great tactile sound and feel. Very springy with a satisfying click on each tap, yet the machine itself feels as though one slip, and it's falling apart. The shelled plastic does not feel very sturdy, and I would caution using this as a \"run-and-gun\" laptop as I wouldn't trust the durability.\n\nThis leads me to my ultimate issue, and where I would have trouble recommending to anyone with my stature. When using the laptop in my lap, there arises an issue where if I rest my wrist on the \"wrist rest\" area, the pressure causes the bottom of the laptop to compress, and the trackpad will stop clicking. At first, I just thought the machine only supported gestures tapping, but once my daughter and wife used, the ma chine, I realized it was directly correlated to my wrist pressure. It is sporadic depending on wrist angle, but very frustrating when trying to navigate swiftly, thus limiting the full useability of the machine. For that, I dropped a star and would only recommend on a specific basis.\n\nIn summary, it is a basic machine that I would only recommend to very casual users who happen to exert light pressure on the wrist rest. Very specific, but that's what it is.",

      "title": "Great Performance",
      "body": "The HP 15.6\" Laptop has great performance, and can easily handle any basic multi-tasking, or work/school related tasks. I have no issue running multiple spreadsheets, browser tabs, and productivity apps at the same time. The laptop is light and quiet, and the screen is good for the price range. The sound quality is decent, and enjoying movies or videos on this laptop is a good experience. The build quality is overall ok, but lacking at the price point in my opinion. When typing on the keyboard there is a large amount of flex, and the keys have a very interesting tactile feel but are somehow still very slippery. When typing there is a large amount of flex on the casing which hampers the typing experience, and when using the touchpad it is much worse and actually makes using the touchpad a pretty bad user experience. The battery life is great, especially for such a light laptop. I was able to watch several movies on a single charge, so this would be very sufficient for a cross country flight. Overall this laptop performs very well, keyboard and touchpad are the downsides.",

I don't have much to compare it to, but you can twist the whole thing and it flexes pretty easily with little pressure.  I don't think it effects performance, but might not be that durable if you live a rough and tumble life.\nI'd don't much like the action of the keyboard either.  It has a real light and cheap feel to it.  Maybe it is just personal preference, but I prefer a bit heavier and thicker feel to the keyboard action, if you know what I mean.\nThe computing power seems adequate for what I do, which is not much, basic writing and some excel book keeping.  I've watched a few movies on it, and the screen resolution is good.  Internet seems a bit slow, but it is hard for me to determine if that is from the laptop or my internet service.\nI recommend the laptop with the caveat that I only use it for simple needs.",

Then, just 7 months later, the power cord for one stopped working. For the other one, Windows was corrupted. These computers were supposed to enable our family to all play games (well, just the one game) together. Instead, they have been nothing but a headache.
