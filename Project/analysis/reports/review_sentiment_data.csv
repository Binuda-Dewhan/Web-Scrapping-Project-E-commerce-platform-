Dell,Dell i3530-7728BLK-PUS,"I’ve been using the Dell Inspiron 15-inch laptop equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of SSD storage, and I can say with complete satisfaction that it has exceeded my expectations.

From the very first use, the system’s fluidity is evident. The Core i7 processor delivers excellent performance, ideal for both demanding tasks and everyday use. The response speed is impressive, allowing me to work without interruptions and run multiple programs with no slowdowns.

In addition, the 16 GB of RAM provides a smooth multitasking experience, and the 1 TB SSD storage not only ensures plenty of space but also allows the system to boot up and load files in seconds. It’s truly a pleasure to work with such a fast and responsive laptop.

As for the interface and design, it’s modern, intuitive, and comfortable. Everything is designed to enhance the user experience. I also have to highlight the graphics card, which performs perfectly for editing, design tasks, or simply enjoying multimedia content in excellent quality.

In summary, I’m delighted with this laptop. It has met and even exceeded my expectations. It’s an investment that’s worth every penny for its performance, speed, and overall efficiency.",0.40375000000000005,Positive

I usually have several browser tabs open, along with Excel and Photoshop, and this laptop handles it without breaking a sweat.
The 1 TB SSD is a game-changer. It’s incredibly fast and I don’t have to worry about running out of storage any time soon. File transfers are quick, and the system boots in under 10 seconds.",0.15740740740740738,Positive
Dell,Dell i3530-7728BLK-PUS,"With the i7 processor and 16GB RAM, the laptop handles multitasking with ease. Whether I’m running multiple Chrome tabs, using Excel, or editing light videos, everything runs smoothly without noticeable lag. The build is sleek and professional, though it’s mostly plastic. It’s sturdy enough for daily use, but not the most premium feel compared to higher-end Dell XPS models.",0.2375,Positive

Dell,Dell i3530-7728BLK-PUS,"System roars, but the weak link is the screen, which seems smaller than past 15inch, in part this could be a lower height or the lousy implementation of Win11. No way to control the task bar which is HUGH, and takes up too much room. 

The sound is also lower than in prior Dell models , acceptable but lower. 

I would look for a larger screen, and perhaps a different vendor. I use an additional screen, and this works way better than in Win10.",-0.0025000000000000022,Neutral

From a design perspective, the 16-inch screen provides ample workspace, making it easy to multitask, and the display quality is fantastic for long hours of use. It’s also lightweight enough to be portable, which is a plus for me as a student and professional.

Overall, this laptop has exceeded my expectations. If you’re in cybersecurity, tech, or any field requiring speed, storage, and reliability, the Inspiron 16 is a solid choice. Highly recommended!",0.19032738095238097,Positive
Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I bought this computer for the main purpose of running small business from home and so far it’s been a great experience. The computer is far and has great graphics. I love that you can switch between keyboard and tablet modes. The backlight keyboard makes it very easy to work in low light or dark environments. AI support features are also helpful. I need a big screen and this computer size is perfect and big touchpad is also nice. Thin, amazing speaker volume, low blue light feature is awesome. One thing I will say is that it is heavy so not the easiest for mobility, but given the size of the computer it’s expected, and the screen can get very glassy with light. Lastly, battery life is super good.

The hinge into tablet mode is smooth and seems sturdy. You can't unlock it, if you're computer goes to sleep in tablet mode; so you do have to get back upright to log in.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"Quick Overview
=================================
If you've kept up with Dell over the years, you may think (like I do) that they have WAY too many product lines and models to keep up with! Normally, we may be tempted to classify their Inspiron lineup of PCs with some ""basic"" computer users but not something premium, like their XPS line or an Apple MacBook Pro. Well, this is Dell's response - a high-quality all-metal, high-powered laptop that feels as premium as all but the best laptops out there. Let's see how it performs!


Overall build
=================================
The post-industrial recycled aluminum is as premium as they come and I love that the edges aren't sharp corners like you find on some MacBook Pros or Razer Blade laptops. Smooth edges all-around the laptop and a sturdy hinge make this feel like a premium 2-in-1. There's just enough ""give"" in the screen when you need to move it or flip it but it doesn't bounce at all while typing. On the left side, there are HDMI, USB-A, and two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports that can be used with the included 90w charger. On the right side, there's a USB-A, combo headset/headphone jack, and a full-sized SD card reader slot.

The backlit keyboard has very light actuation and is quiet. It's a bit too soft for my tastes (preferring mechanical keyboards or Lenovo Thinkpad-style keyboards), but others in the household thought it was fine. Note, this has a dedicated Microsoft Co-pilot key to the right of the spacebar (past the ""alt"" key) for instant access to Microsoft's Co-pilot.

Large speaker grilles on the left and right side of the keyboard deck house 2 speakers with Dolby Atmos Core/Waves MaxxAudio Pro certifications.

The screen is a nice 16"" 1920x1200 WVA display with 300 nits of brightness. It's decently color accurate (99.6% sRGB and 69.9% Adobe RGB), responsive to touch, and has very little to no backlight bleeding.

Overall, I really like the build-quality and feel. Throughout my testing, it never got too hot to the touch, nor did the keyboard deck get overly warm.




Initial setup
=================================
If you've set up a Windows 11 PC recently, you know you've got 20-30 minutes of set up time to get online, download updates, and then decline a lot of Microsoft offerings. After all that is done, it's finally time to use the computer!

I was very pleased with the input devices - the keyboard and large touchpad are responsive and the texture of scrolling on the trackpad is perfect. As mentioned, I didn't love the keyboard's softness (and I still don't), but I think it's something you can get used to if this was your main device. The touchscreen is nice and responsive. Interacting with content felt completely natural. I think a device this size is a bit too large to use as a tablet, but I could see this doing ""kiosk"" or ""tent"" duty as a media player.

Loading up a few things to test including CPUID's HWmonitor, Adobe Creative Suite, and Davinci Resolve showed that this is more than capable as a content-creator's laptop.




Performance
=================================
The stats on this Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 (7640) are impressive! An Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor (16 cores), 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB m.2 NVMe SSD, and Intel Arc graphics are high-end except for more of an integrated GPU vs. a truly dedicated one. Still, the performance on applications like benchmarks and real-world applications like Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Davinci Resolve were impressive. I didn't miss much compared to my high-end gaming PC that I usually run these tasks on. I will say, this Dell Inspiron 16 is much quieter, even at full-load, than my gaming PC. It never got annoyingly loud nor hot. Hot/warm keyboard decks can be annoying since they can make your palms sweat which isn't a great feeling. I did sense some warmth, but nowhere near what I've seen on some other devices.

The screen was accurate enough for me (not a professional photographer nor graphic designer, but I do have many creative pursuits) and comparing the built-in display to my external monitors had pretty similar results.

I didn't personally test the SSD, but I felt like everything was very responsive (as they should be on something so highly spec'd). Checking online, this same SSD is highly rated and highly performant, so it's a great value that they included a 1 TB version in this model.

If you're a gamer, you'll always want dedicated graphics. If this is a hybrid-device that is intended as a workhorse first with the ability to occasionally play some older games, then Intel's integrated Arc GPU may work! I wouldn't recommend playing Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings, but older games like less-graphically intense FPS/shooters, RPGs, or strategy games work great. For example, Civilization VI can break 60 fps at medium settings. Since I have a backlog of games I'll never get under control, a device like this could help me knock out some of the older titles I've always meant to get around to.

Connectivity-wise, I had no issues with Intel's Wi-Fi 6E AX211 NIC and my home 6E system. I wouldn't have minded if it had an RJ45 port on it, but I totally understand why they decided to leave it off. Physically there were plenty of ports and I never felt the need (like I do on some thin/light laptops) to get the dongles out to have enough ports.

The speakers, though certified, are better than OK. I recently had the pleasure of testing out Asus' G14's speakers and they are super-impressive for laptop speakers. These Inspiron 16 speakers are good - certainly better than most laptops and much better than most tablets (my Samsung S8 Ultra or Asus Z13 Flow).

Battery life is long enough to last a full day of working away from power outlets and when you do get access to one, you can charge up to 80% in just an hour. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the performance of the very new Intel CPU/GPU combination. It's fast, powerful, and quiet!




Conclusion
=================================
I was really impressed by this new Inspiron 16. I never would have considered buying an Inspiron before since I could choose from either Alienware, XPS, or even their business-focused Latitude line. This new Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 really improves my impression of their Inspiron line up which was, uninspiring to say the least. I can confidently say that this new model is a solid, high-quality, high-performing PC that can do WAY more than just browse the web and pay bills online. These specs, along with the Intel Arc GPU, really allow this PC to do some content-creation, media editing, and light gaming.",0.2416749011857707,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"Look and Feel 
--------------------
A mega display touch enabled laptop that’s just so easy to work on. Having been using phones for so long, it comes naturally to touch the screen for inputs. And touch enabled laptops are so convenient that way. The ice blue color gives it a cool look.  


Build Quality  
------------------
A 360° hinge transforms laptop into four modes – laptop, tent, stand and Tab mode. Transition is pretty smooth and keypad disables by itself for tent, stand and tab modes. The TAB mode is brilliant - just like a huge tab, it automatically changes orientation based on how we hold the laptop. This is especially useful when we read an e-book or documents and feels awesome when we play games. 
At around 4.8 lbs (2.2 kg) this may not be on the lighter side, but it’s not difficult to carry around. With less than an inch of height, this is slim. With minimal bezel, this feels quite compact for a 16 inch laptop. 
 
Boot Speed 
----------------
With only about 15 seconds boot time, this is extremely quick to load the lock screen. Fingerprint sensor is excellent and really fast making it extremely convenient to unlock the laptop. Overall the desktop loads within about 18 seconds from the time the laptop is powered on. Another great feature is, opening the lid automatically powers on the laptop. If the lid is already open, fingerprint button does the trick. This is very practical and well done DELL!

Display Quality 
---------------------
16 inch Full HD+ touch display with aspect ratio of 16:10 (1920 x 1200) with max brightness of 300 nits. Thanks to 300 nits, its super bright, usable outdoors as well. I generally use it at 50% brightness. This features ComfortView Plus Support through MyDell app offering additional display settings like Comfortview (with blue light filters), movie, sports and animation mode and brings improvement and Dolby Vision optimized for bright, dark and vivid environments. 

I also use a 14 inch Dell Inspiron and in comparison this definitely feels superb. The display is much larger and it’s so nice to use a larger display. It’s like the difference we feel between a 6 inch and a 6.7 inch phone. With a larger display (and the additional battery capacity) the weight of the laptop increases but in my opinion, the pleasure of the larger display topples the hassles of the additional weight.

Webcam
------------
With 1080p resolution, the webcam provides an excellent quality video during the calls. This also comes with a privacy shutter to close the camera when needed (or not needed).  

Battery  
------------
This has an outstanding battery life. With a 6-cell 90 WHr high-capacity battery, DELL claims 15 hour battery life. It just took 1 hour to charge from 0 to 80%. 1 hr and 35 minutes for a full charge. After full charging it on day 1, I am on day 4 and used about a couple of hours per day and am still at 48%. This includes a 1 hour video call as well. 

Speakers
--------------
This comes with Dolby Atmos Quad speakers and its really loud. This is another area where this laptop beats the DELL Inspiron 14 by a huge margin. 

Processor 
-------------
This laptop comes with Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H processor and 16GB RAM and preloaded with Windows 11 Home 64 bit OS. 
This is one of the high end processor and the laptop has no lag in launching or switching between all the apps that I am using. It’s extremely fast, be it loading the apps or switching between them. Ultra 7 means this laptop will support AI as well. 
1 TB Solid State drive offers plenty of storage space and thankfully this doesn’t have an internal hard disc and the entire storage is SSD offering greater speed and no noise. 

Games 
----------
This is not meant to be a high end gaming laptop and this is not made for this purpose. However, thanks to Intel Arc graphic card, this supports many mid level games. For someone like me, who play mid level games occasionally, this has proved more than sufficient. I was able to play games like F1 2020 with no difficulties which requires moderate graphics requirement. 

Keyboard and Trackpad 
---------------------------------
This is another area where this laptop excels. The keypad feels soft, rich and premium, almost no sound. The backlit keyboard is really handy when used in dark. The trackpad is huge and very responsive and I could use it with “low” sensitivity to prevent accidental taps. The keypad could have been positioned slightly lower than they are. But I almost got used to it in no time.  

WiFi 
--------
WiFi 6E, the new technology offers superior connectivity. There were no drops and seems reliable. This is also capable of sharing WiFi internet with mobile hotspot feature. 

Ports
---------
It is equipped with all the necessary ports. 
- 2 thunderbolts USB-C ports 
- 2 USB A ports on either side of the laptop
- 1 HDMI 1.4 port (Please note, the maximum resolution supported over HDMI is 1920x1080 @60HZ. There is no 4K output)
- 1 3.5mm Audio jack (Obviously laptop can be connected via Bluetooth audio devices for videos and calls)
- 1 SD Card reader

Hardware
-------------
This being the core of the laptop, I am so glad this laptop has checked all the boxes in this front. 
- 16GB LPDDR5X RAM offers more than necessary speed to tackle all day to day needs including video editing. 
- Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 processor 155H Processor keeps the laptop fast and efficient
- 1 TB and the highlight is its all Solid State Drive (SSD). This is more than adequate storage and not having a HDD is a blessing. No more irritating HDD rotating sounds and loading of any files/programs/apps is so quick. This is perfect. 

OS: This comes with Windows 11 Home edition pre-installed. Additionally, 1 month free trial of Office 365 and McAfee is included. 


Summary
-------------
After using the 14 inch DELL Inspiron for a while, this DELL Inspiron 16 feels an obvious upgrade. Superb larger display and much high brightness. Sound is much louder. 
All the applications and games I have used thus far are super quick and had no hassles operating them. 

If you cant decide between a 14 and 16 inch DELL Inspiron, I would recommend the 16 inch. Especially, if you do not connect to an external monitor, then I would definitely suggest to go with a larger display such as this, as the 14” feels a bit smaller. Plus the added advantage of superior sound, higher end processor. 

Overall I am very happy with this laptop and I have no hesitation to recommend this.",0.23883658008658,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"The Dell Inspiron 16 7640 2-in-1 laptop is  new convertible laptop from Dell. It blends versatility, power, and style into one neat package!

Dell calls the case color Ice Blue, but it looks more like a medium metallic grey. The keyboard has matching color keys with blue backlighting, including a new copilot key next to the right alt key for quick access to Copilot. With a double-hinged screen, it can be used as a laptop, tablet or in tent configuration, providing maximum flexibility for work or play.

The laptop features a 16-inch 16:10 FHD+ touchscreen with a max resolution of 1920 x 1200. The Intel Arc Graphics deliver smooth visuals, making it suitable for multimedia and light gaming. An optional active pen is available from Dell if you need it.
The laptop offers a variety of ports, including 2 USB A 3.2 USB A ports,  2 Thunderbolt 4.0 ports, 1 Universal audio jack, 1 HDMI 1.4 port (max resolution 1920x1080 @60Hz), and 1 SD card slot, providing ample connectivity options. The Thunderbolt 4.0 ports both support  DisplayPort 2.1 and Power Delivery. You could theoretically connect 3 additional screens with the built in ports.
This laptop is Powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor reaching up to 4.8GHz utilizing 16 cores and 22 threads it can handle most chores easily. The laptop is fitted with 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and is expandable to 32GB this allows plenty of memory for any program.  Storage is handled by a fast 1TB Sk hyinx BC901 NVME SSD.  Windows 11 Home is included, you may want to upgrade to Windows 11 pro if you need to join a domain at work or need the extra security features. This laptop stays cool and quiet due to the Dell Advanced cooling system. 

The backlit keyboard has a great feel and a cool blue glow. The keys have good travel and recoil. There is an integrated fingerprint reader in the power button at the right end of the upper row of keys that supports windows hello, sadly the webcam does not support it. The trackpad is large and has good sensitivity with good feel while clicking.

The laptop has four tuned speakers with audio processing by Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro, delivering an immersive sound experience. I was surprised by the sound from the built in speakers. They are more than adequate for any media streaming and lite gaming.  The integrated widescreen FHD webcam with dual digital microphone array and Temporal Noise Reduction ensures clear video calls.

With a 6-cell, 90 WHr high-capacity battery and ExpressCharge capability, the laptop offers outstanding battery life, i got between 6 and 7 hours per charge. The laptop has two charging modes using Standard charge the laptop charges fully charge in 3 hours  With  ExpressCharge  you can charge  in a little over 2 hours, from 0 to 80% in 75 minutes and 100% in 135 minutes.

Another cool feature is Intel Unison which allows you to sync your laptop with any phone, regardless of OS and transfer file, photos or video. You will have to download the app to your phone or your tablet to  use it.

Advanced features are available due to the Integrated AI NPU that enables features like Windows Studio Effects for background blur and tracking.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"First, I was a little disappointed to find that my new Dell Inspiron 16” 7640 2-in-1 Touch Laptop arrived with a small scuff on the left front corner of the lid.  The shipping box and product box were both undamaged, leaving me to assume that this brand-new laptop was shipped from Dell already scuffed.

I have been happy with Dell products for years.  In fact, our family currently owns several Dell laptops and are happy with all of them.

This happens so transparently anymore, that I’m not sure it’s even worth mentioning, but as always during setup, this Dell Inspiron 7640 connected easily to my home’s Wi-Fi.  It quickly found my Wi-Fi and several of our neighbors and all I had to do was select our home’s Wi-Fi and provide the password.  It has reliably reconnected each time I booted up the laptop.

One of the first things I do when I get a new laptop is listen to the sound.  I typically don’t have high expectations for any laptop’s built-in speakers, because most everybody nowadays connects by Bluetooth to high-quality external speakers, headphones, or earbuds.  But usually, laptop speakers are at least passable for listening.

Unfortunately, that seems to be a weak point on the Inspiron 7640.  Even though it boasts 2x2W Dolby Atmos quad built-in speakers, they must be really poor quality, and I would rate them not even passable.  They would be okay for online meetings or listening to voice-only videos, but not music.  I’m not sure how to describe the sound from these speakers other than they sound exactly like you would expect very cheap speakers to sound…tinny highs, no discernible bass at all, and almost no pleasant mid-tones.  I did not drop this review by a star for this because nobody really expects to listen to music using just a laptop speakers.

But once it effortlessly, connected it to my wife’s new Bluetooth speaker it was game on, and we listened to hours upon hours of streamed music through this laptop.  It kept a solid Bluetooth connection with absolutely no skipping, stuttering, or dropouts.

A big plus for this Inspiron 7640 is its processor speed.  This is a very fast computer boasting one of the latest generation CPUs, the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H.  It’s basic speed is 1.4 GHz jumping to 4.8 GHz in turbo mode and can handle up to 22 threads.  I give this CPU package high marks for overall speed.

My Inspiron 7640 came equipped with, not just a 1 TB SSD, but a 1 TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe Solid State Drive, the fastest form factor available.  I was also happy to see that my Inspiron came with an SD card slot.  A lot of laptops these days are being made without an SD card slot thus forcing you into buying USB-C accessories just read an SD card.

The FHD+ display quality is really pretty decent.  The touchscreen display and its hinge seem to be well engineered because the screen doesn’t shake at all even up near the top like when you’re using the ribbon menu in Office products.  The well-engineered hinge is stiff, yet it’s not too stiff.  I’m still able to open the clam shell lid easily.

I have a disability with my hands that affects my hand strength, touch sensation, fine motor control, and dexterity.  Happily, I found the touchpad on this new Dell Inspiron to have just enough drag on my fingertips for me to accurately control it with my messed-up hands.  This is a critical factor for me when choosing laptops because if the touchpad is too slick, I’m unable to control it properly and then I have to use an external mouse which is not always desired or convenient.

Dell’s backlit keyboard is great when using the Inspiron in a lowlight environment.  I absolutely love that feature and also the fact that I can easily turn it on/off with the F5 key only.

The life of a full battery charge is most excellent, taking over 14 hours to drop from a 100% battery down to 1%.  My basic test for battery is to stream music videos to an external Bluetooth speaker.  I was overjoyed at this incredible battery charge life.  My last new Dell Inspiron two years ago took 8½ hours to reach 2%.  That’s roughly a 40% increase in battery charge life!  I’m very happy with that!  On the downside, I was disappointed to find out that the 7640’s battery is not replaceable.

Overall, the Dell Inspiron 16 7640 2-in-1 Laptop is a very decent laptop that I can recommend to anyone without reservation as long as you’re not looking for something with excellent built-in speakers.  My Inspiron 7640 appears to be a workhorse of a laptop that would be quite at home in a student’s backpack, in a contractor's pickup truck, on a desk at work, or on the dining room table at home.",0.13610100217243076,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"The Dell - Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 is a well-rounded, full featured daily laptop.


Physical presentation –
This Inspiron 2-in-1 is noticeably heavier than other ultra notebooks in my arsenal but being that this machine is 16 inch – I don’t consider it a show stopper.  The color tone, rounded edges and layout are great.  The screen is vastly uniform but not that bright, so I wouldn’t recommend this machine for anyone prone to using it outdoors or in work areas saturated with a lot of ambient light.  Color, range of brightness control and again – uniformity - are all excellent.  But this display is glossy and lacking any kind of “Pop”.  Being a pen compatible touch screen is a nice bonus.

The touch-pad is remarkably good, large and with an excellent surface that affords precise control.  That part was unexpected.  The port selection on this laptop is well balanced and left me wanting for anything more.  The keyboard is sort of meh to my tastes but not horrible.  It will take a little of time to get use to the tactical feedback of the keys, their size & placement.  I have preference for Lenovo keyboards on laptops but this Inspiron isn’t far below that experience.  The keyboard deck located power button with integrated finger print reader is convenient and makes using Windows Hello logins confident and quick.

The charging brick and USB-C connector are great.  Good for traveling and flexible if one wishes to use an external battery pack or alternate charging brick on trips.
The built in camera does have a physical privacy slider and that is a feature I think many people will appreciate.  One thing I noticed is that as you tilt the screen back, the hinges of this Inspiron will raise the base further off the table surface – providing better breath-ability – which is good – but – since there isn’t any type of protective treatment to that part of the hinge surfaces, I expect that the finish will wear in these spots with continue use.  This feels like a bit of an oversight by the Dell engineers IMHO.
Overall, I feel this 2024 16-inch Inspiron configuration hits all the most important design points and has a build quality you’d expect for the price-point.

Setup –
This newest 14th Gen Core Ultra was a breeze to get going.  There were a couple of firmware updates straight out-of-the-box and the entire process of initializing Windows 11 and updating all drivers/utilities was pleasant & painless.  The newly improved Dell Support utility does a great job of scanning the machine and keeping you informed of available updates.  I only experienced that ‘typical of Dell’ handful of drivers that failed during the Windows Update process – namely a couple of Intel related drivers – but unlike my previous experience with their computers, these self-corrected quickly with no headaches.

Performance –
Please note that all these benchmarks were performed in Balanced Mode while plugged in, with Window 11 Home fully up-to-date at version 23H2.
The included 1 TB SSD is obviously geared towards optimizing battery performance and is nothing to ‘write home about’ but the responsiveness of the system never presented any kind of sluggish or “held back” feeling in normal use.  Write & read speeds were consistently sub-5GB/sec but certainly not horrible.  I personally hold more importance of storage capacity over speed in a platform of this nature.
This machine, not specifically spec’d as a Content Creator platform does perform remarkably well and I attribute that to competency of the newest, 14th Gen Ultra Core i7’s.  The Ultra 7 155H in this Dell - Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop should satisfy most users not expecting the performance levels of more professionally leaning, spec’d machines.  For the average Joe (and Josephine), this machine will handle video & audio rendering just fine – which is another revealing fact of the Intel’s newest Ultra processors.  This laptop scores Cinebench nearly as good as much more expensive machines, only a couple/three generations older.

Summary –
The Dell - Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 is solid offering from Dell.  The build quality is what you’d expect from them, with all modern & essential features here and the performance being solid for an Ultra book style platform at this particular price-point – all with a spacious 16-inch, touch display.  This is a very competent, everyday laptop that should satisfy most users.

Pros
Big, uniform touch display that is pen compatible.
Excellent, spacious track pad that isn’t glass but feels just a good as some of the precision glass ones I’ve used.
Physical camera privacy slider.
Reliable & quick booting, waking and logging in with finger print reader integrated power button.
Dell support utilities have been greatly improved this year and are useful without all the bugs!
WiFi connections are solid & reliable with this Intel AX211 6e onboard device
Good balance of ports and includes a full-sized SD card slot!
Overall system performance is crisp & responsive.

Cons
A few extra levels of added screen brightness would have been preferred for better outdoor use
Not a huge fan of the chic-let keys size & spacing but are still good to type on

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I was looking for a new Windows 11 laptop that I could take on the road and use for my remote photo/video editing and the usual home office applications.  I have used this laptop for 5 days now and I really love it.  I feel this laptop would work very well for most advanced home users wanting a larger screen and don't mind the extra weight.  Also, I feel the 2-in-1 feature would work perfectly for some small business users.

The 16"" screen and 2-in-1 capability have really worked out perfectly for what I use this for.  I was able to install my photo and video editing software and they run smooth and cool with the Intel Ultra 7 155H processor.  It has plenty of venting and fans to keep the laptop cool.  I rarely hear the fans running.  This laptop is fast and startup time and shutdown time is very quick.  I have also taken this on flights and used it to watch a movie and didn't experience any lag.  Even after installing MS-Office and my finance software, everything runs great.

The weight is a little heavy, but I feel that is the trade-off for the 16"" flip touch screen.  The sound and Intel Arc graphics quality are very good.  I would have liked a 2k or greater resolution, but at this price point FHD+ (1920 x 1200) fits better with my budget.  It is engineered with 4-speakers that have Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro.  Which makes watching a movie in a lonely hotel room seem a lot more tolerable.  This laptop also comes with WiFi 6E for fast internet access and has 2 USB-C (Thunderbolt 4.0) ports and 2 USB-A (3.2 gen 1) ports.  However, I would have traded one of the USB-A ports for another USB-C port, because one USB-C port is used for charging, leaving only 1 open.  An HDMI port, Audio Port, and SD card slot complete the laptop's connectivity perfectly.

Most importantly, I haven't had any problems with this laptop since I started using it.  It connects quickly and easily to my wireless BT mouse, keyboard, and headphones.  The keyboard is very comfortable to use and has a nice, light touch and sound.  They also added a fingerprint reader and a Windows Copilot key to the keyboard.  The display panel includes an integrated Webcam (1080p) with dual noise cancelling microphones.  The video quality of the webcam and sound quality of the microphone is very good.  I regularly give remote presentations to clients and they haven't yet complained that they couldn't hear or see me well.

The 16GB memory and 1TB SSD storage are adequate for me.  Also, I did notice that Dell responded to a Q&A that the memory is upgradeable to 32GB.  But, it is the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H (24MB cache, 16 cores, 22 threads, up to 4.8 GHz), Intel Arc Graphics, and 16GB memory (LPDDR5X at 6400MT/s) that really makes this laptop standout.  These are upgrades for many laptops and all of my applications run very quick.  Even when I am listening to music and editing some photos or videos at the same time.

So far I have used this laptop to watch movies on the plane and in a hotel room, do some quick photo/video while traveling, upload files to social media, and stay up-to-date with internet, email, Zoom, and give presentations for my clients.  Overall, I really like everything about the Dell Inspiron 16"" 2-in-1 touch laptop with these specifications and features.  I also feel the price makes this a very good value given Dell's reputation, and their quality and commitment to service.  I highly recommend this laptop and it would make a great present.",0.2966483382209189,Positive

Dell - Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor - 16GB Memory - 1TB SSD – Intel Arc Graphics - Ice Blue
Model: i7640-7366BLU-PU

REVIEW

As a gamer I always want more power, more screen, more RAM, more of everything.    In this case I just need a sturdy and reliable laptop with a touchscreen, for my Wife, to replace her aging Dell 2-in-1 Laptop from around 2016.  My wife uses her laptop for crafting, doing puzzles, and couch surfing.   She required a touch screen, and something with solid performance.   Although her old Dell laptop is 4K/16GB with a budget GPU, I can’t say she knows what that means or even cares.  

So, from her context, this is more or less a 1:1 replacement at the same price point as 7 years ago.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

As expected, and as previously experienced with other Dell’s, the Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 is well built and solidly constructed.  The screen is vibrant and bright (300 nits) it will do OK outdoors, but not outstanding in full sun.

Some upgrades that I appreciate is a full 1080p camera, that does a good job on video calls.  I also like the full Wi-Fi 6e support for faster connectivity.  The battery life is much better than on older models and reportedly can exceed 15 hours.  In a few days of testing, the battery has held up well.

Finally, I like the combination of ports.  Thunderbolt 4 ports means I can easily dock this laptop to an external docking station for ease of use or expand the laptop with more USB ports if needed without impacting performance.   I’m also happy to see a real, and full-size HDMI port, in case I need to connect to older monitors (instead of thunderbolt 4 / DisplayPort over USB).  I am curious about the “*” in the specs that state you can only drive a 1080p monitor from the HDMI port.    This is curious, but must be real if they put a disclaimer on the spec sheet.  That does not seem to apply to the Thunderbolt connectivity.  I’m driving a 4K external screen for my testing with it just fine (3 screens at once were not issue from my dock).  I do wish it had a built in ethernet port, but that is not a big deal for most people and can easily be solved with a docking station anyway.

SETUP

As with all Win11 laptops, just follow along and you are setup, so that part is easy.  Other than “Dell branded” bloatware and McAfee, this was not much to uninstall.

TESTING

I’m not going to go crazy with testing and specs (I’m fighting my geek instincts here).  The Dell seems responsive, the keyboard is nice.  I hate touchpads and so does my wife, but with a touch screen and external mouse, that is not an issue.   I was able to get the expected speeds from my external Thunderbolt 4 drive.  You are not going to be doing much of any gaming with this laptop, other than online games, so there is no need to test graphics performance on AAA games.

OK I had to do one test, more for curiosity, than any actual need.  The Drive in my build is a KIOXIA (never heard of it), but performance was top notch for an NVME Gen 4 drive 6K Read / 5K Write.

RECOMMENDATION

If you want a well-built laptop for everyday use (not gaming), that will hold up for years, I think this is worth a close look.   It is in the high-end price range for the class of screen, but if it holds up as well as my previous four 2-in-1 Inspirons, then it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.   None of my prior four Inspirons ever died or failed after, even after 5-7 years of adult use.  It was just time for upgrades.  The only thing slightly lacking is a built in 4K screen, but it is not a big deal for this use.",0.16311274509803922,Positive

Maybe a bit too much for what I need for now, but I keep my products for a long time and the high specs will carry over time.

First, BitLocker was enabled by default, which I had to disable. Even after that, some hardware drivers were not easily accessible. Device Manager doesn’t even display memory chips, and due to Dell’s proprietary configuration, disk mirroring software cannot detect the SSD. If I had to do it again, I'd go with a more open platform.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1, 7640 Laptop is a nice upgrade from my most recent Dell Inspiron 7000!  I have a few Dell computers/laptops and this one did not disappoint.

Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, Windows 11, 1 TB storage, 16GB memory, with 16” display.  It comes with 30-day Trial offer for Microsoft Office, 4.8lbs, 4 speakers, Dolby Atmos Core and Waves MaxxAudio Pro, Integrated FHD Webcam and digital microphone, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth wireless card and a 90Wh Battery (battery life up to 15 hrs), power cable, and a little paper with QR code and warranty paper included.

Out of the very well packaged box this is an Ice Blue 2-in-1 Laptop that is a little on the heavy side – but very sturdy!  This is replacing (working with) my other 2019 Dell 2-in1 and I am very pleased so far!  The laptop booted up very quickly as I just followed along, made my selections and was on my way! It had a semi charged battery that lasted for a while before I had to recharge.  After selecting my network, it checked and installed updates – again quickly.  I linked my printers and phone to the new Dell and imported some data from my 2019 Dell easily.  I am not really a gamer aside from Solitaire and some word games so probably won’t take full advantage of all gaming capabilities of this computer.  I do, however, do my work, documents, web searches etc. from this and it is a very capable laptop.  I have had no issues, battery performance is great, the laptop stays pretty cool for the hours I am on it, and it wakes right up when I open it.  The audio is very good with the side speakers on the keyboard area; however, I am sad that the speakers take up so much of the keyboard area and did not allow for the number pad on the right side… tough to get used to no number pad/calculator option.  This has probably been my biggest challenge – getting used to the finger positioning of the keyboard.  On that topic, the keyboard keys are a bigger size and comfortable to use and I like the backlit keyboard.

This comes with a Windows Copilot Key that kind of gives you an AI assistant which is helpful finding you answers and solutions!  It also has 2 thunderbolt USB-C ports (very useful for me to link my Samsung phone cord to) and also the laptop charging cord, 2 USB A ports on either side, an HDMI port, an audio jack and my favorite is the SD card reader!

The 2-in-1 hinge feature is strong and very useful when watching a movie or showing a slide show.  The colors are vibrant and easy on the eye.  All in all, this is a very nice, capable, upgraded Dell computer/laptop that has a competitive price point and I think is a great product by Dell.",0.24435434074968956,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"After all these years, Dell is still putting out amazing computers and setting the bar for what laptops should be! I cant even count how many Dell laptops I have owned over the years, and they have always been very solid, quality, well-built machines.  This laptop is no different.  Out of the box you will see this is a quality machine.  It has a good weight to it (some may think it’s a little on the heavier side) but I think its on par considering it’s a 16” laptop.  I believe the spec sheet says its 4.8 pounds.  
In the box you just get the basics, the laptop, power cable, and some minor documentation and that’s it.  
When you start up the laptop you’ll see the advantage of the fast processor and 1TB SSD.  This thing boots up in a matter of seconds.  You’ll have to go through the usual Windows setup before you can use the laptop.  Once you're finished with that, you’ll see that Dell doesn’t include too much bloatware.  That’s one thing I always loved about Dell.  They usually keep it pretty simple and only include the essentials and a few trials of things like Office and Antivirus programs. 
The display is very nice looking, sad that its only 1920 X 1200 FHD+, I would have liked to see a slightly higher resolution for the price point, but for most people, it will be fine.  
The keyboard Dell uses in their laptops always has a good feel to them and I find it very easy to type quickly on them.  As always, it is also backlit so its great for working at night or in dimly-lit spaces. 
The ins and outs should be enough for most people.  On one side there are 2 USB-C ports (that are also used for charging), one regular USB port and a full-size HDMI port.  On the other side is a SD card reader, headphone jack, and a second regular USB port.  
Getting into the performance, this has an Intel Core 7 Series 1 processor with 16GB of Ram, a 1TB SSD drive and Intel Arc graphics.  I use mine mainly for browsing the web, checking emails, watching streaming movies as well as for more work-oriented stuff like Photoshop, Illustrator, and video editing with Premiere.  One of my main hobbies is flying my drone.  I love that there is a SD card slot so I can easily transfer my videos to the large hard drive and that there is plenty of power for me to easily be able to edit my footage and get it uploaded to YouTube.  I also regularly use Photoshop to edit photos as well and this machine can easily handle editing of very large files without any hiccups.  
For fun I also installed some games on this to se how the gaming performance would be.  It’s acceptable, but this is far from a gaming machine.  But for keeping yourself occupied on the road, it will definitely be able to do that! 
I also love that this is a 2 in 1 machine so it can be completely folded in half and used as a tablet.  I have always loved having this feature on a laptop because its just 1 less gadget you have to haul around with you.  
I found the battery life to be great on this laptop.  As always, it depends heavily on what you are using it for and the CPU load and your settings, but I found this to be as good or even slightly better than most laptops in this spec range.  
I think this would be great as a daily laptop.  It can easily handle most office tasks and is great for kicking back at home and watching videos or doing other fun productivity work.  
As I always say, you can’t go wrong with a Dell.  They are solid machines built with quality parts that perform great! Definitely check this out if you are in the market for a new laptop.",0.25311982065553496,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"This Dell Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop checks all these top-of-the-line boxes for me:

Screen size (16”) - check!
Touch screen – check!
Super-fast processor (Intel Core Ultra 7) – check!
Lots of memory (16GB) – check!
Lots of storage (1TB of SSD storage) – check!
Backlit keyboard – check!
Good graphics (Intel Arc Graphics) – check!
Good screen resolution (1920x1200) – check!
Latest operating system (Windows 11 Home) – check!
Lots of ports – (HDMI and four USB ports) - check!
Headphone Jack – check!
Microphone Input – check!
Connectivity (Bluetooth & WiFi) – check!
Front-facing Camera – check!
Built-in Microphone – check!

Typing on this lighted keyboard is a real pleasure, whether you’re working during the day or late at night. And the touchscreen helps with navigating around your screen to choose your available options.

With the included WiFi and Bluetooth, you have all the options you need for making connections, both online and with other devices.

The fast processor and sufficient memory work together to make things happen lickety-split.

The battery life between charges is around twelve hours, but of course your mileage will vary, depending on how you’re using this device. Suffice it to say that it’s probably sufficient to get most users through the day.

With the included camera and microphone, this device is an excellent choice for those online video sessions with your friends and business associates.

Finally, the warranty that comes with this device is far superior to what’s offered on most competing laptops. It includes one year on both parts and labor, with onsite/in-home service after remote diagnosis.",0.38833333333333336,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"This laptop 2-in-1 is quite heavy.  I don't see a lot of people being able to use it as a tablet lying down.  In a A frame setup it works quite nicely.  The monitor is crystal clear and touch is very responsive.  A stylus will work with the touch screen.

As a laptop, don't expect to do heavy gaming.  You do not have a dedicated graphics card (Intel Arc Graphics), so my performance tests scored it low in 3D and 2D results.  It still managed a very respectable score near the 70th percentile.  This is actually quite surprising for a 2-in-1.  You can make it by with mid to low graphics on some intensive games.  But you are not going to replace a gaming laptop or rig with this.

What this laptop does well is a little bit of everything.  It is a perfect size for coding, Office work, browsing and media consumption.  The colors are fantastic.  The air flow seems to be quite good.  I have not felt it overly warm at any point.  

The exterior is quite smooth and slick.  Folding it into table mode has the keyboard exposed on the back.  This gives a little better grip to the tablet mode.

In laptop mode, the keyboard is backlit and the touchpad is massive and very responsive.  

The Inspiron is just a touch below the XPS series of laptops from Dell.  This is much more a business type laptop.  Overall it is perfect for my son and his coding classes at school.  It is heavy but the screen real estate makes the weight worth it.  

The ability to flip into a A frame mode and connect a external mouse and keyboard is a big plus.  This is something that differentiates the Inspirons from the XPS.  

You have ports for USB (2) and USB C (2) as well as full size HDMI (1).  The power cord is USB C/Thunderbolt 4.0, this will burn one of the USB C ports.  I always keep a USB hub or two handy.  

Processor is a i7.  There is 16 GB of memory.  There is a finger print reader that works very well.  Also the graphics is Intel Arc, decent performance but really helps the battery life.

Battery life has been really good so far.  Under a moderate load while installing software and configuring Windows I only used about 10% of the battery.  That was over about an hour to an hour and a half.  Lots of IO during that time and screen was on constant.  It charges quite quickly as well.  Unfortunately I did not time that.

Overall, I like this 2-in-1 especially using it for general purposes. It performs well enough that it is perfect for business use, class use, coding and doing presentations.   If you aren't wanting to play No Mans Sky on max graphics, you will be quite pleased with this laptop.",0.20382599580712785,Positive
Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I was skeptical at first, but this thing impressed me. The 2-1 Inspiron has a very good touch screen and build quality. The battery life is good, it last multiple days for me when not in ALL day use (9+ hours straight). 16gb ram is impressive for the price point as well as 1TB SSD. I got this on sale at $750 with a regular price of right at $1100. Seemed too good to be true but did not disappoint whatsoever. I run multiple applications, and have at least 5 tabs open with no slow down. Set up was easy and then I upgraded some drivers on my own. It can run multiple external monitors fluidly with no lag. It handles work task very good. Intel Core ULTRA 7 is a big perk as it’s a top of the line processor. I didn’t want to break the bank but I needed a solid build and good performing laptop. This is the one. I love Dell over other brands, but have not had one in a few years. This laptop overall is a great all in one. Especially if bought on sale. The 2-1 feature is pretty cool even though I don’t use it much it’s still cool to flip over and use it for a demonstration. It doesn’t run hot like people have complained, it gets warm, but don’t all laptops to do that eventually? It is not an overheating type heat either, it just gets warm. Very tolerable and normal.

When I entered my service, it was already registered in Brazil !!! Then I saw a small, triangular blue,grey and white sticker that I never really looked at closely before. It has Dell colors.

I could try to install new drivers manually but honestly this is not something I want to or should be dealing with in 2024. Also, the screen has an ugly yellow tint, like eye care mode is permanently turned on, and the speakers sound like there is plastic covering them. The build quality is really nice though.",-0.03678977272727272,Neutral
Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I have been using my new Dell - Inspiron 16” 2-in-1 Touch Laptop for a few days now and it is well on its way to replacing my older desktop PC.  I just need to finish installing a bunch more programs and transfer all my docs, pics and videos to it.  Dell was able to fit desktop level performance components into a relatively slim package at about ¾” thick and about 4.8 lbs.  This model comes with the latest generation Intel Core Ultra 7 - 155H CPU w/16-cores and Max Turbo Boost Frequency up to 4.8 GHz.  When it comes to multi-tasking for work or play this is a true workforce.  Moreover the 16 GB of high speed DDR5 memory is plenty to simultaneously run many modern apps, create and edit large documents, graphics, videos, spreadsheets and presentations.  Also contributing to the stellar performance is the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive that helps boot this laptop in less than 20 seconds.  The Intel Arc graphics is no slouch either.  It offers about 150% boost in benchmark performance over last generation Intel Iris Xe graphics.  It’s great for everyday home and business use and light to medium gaming..  The 16” LED touchscreen has very bright and vivid colors in FHD+ resolution (1920x1200) with very thin bezels, great for work productivity and HD movies. Speaking of HD movies, this laptop has 4 Dolby Atmos speakers built-in for some of the most immersive sound you can get from a laptop. Additionally it also incorporates a 1080p webcam but no infrared sensors used by Windows Hello for face recognition to unlock your computer.  You can use the built-in fingerprint reader to unlock your screen instead. Another nice touch is the backlit keyboard which makes this laptop easy to type on in any lighting conditions.

As for external connectivity, the Inspiron 16” 7640 is well equipped with two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A for legacy devices and two USB-C Thunderbolt 4.0 ports and an SD-card reader. The laptop also comes with the latest generation low-power consumption Bluetooth as well a very fast  Intel® Wi-Fi 6E AX211, 2x2, 802.11ax wireless card.  Last but not least, an HDMI 1.4 port offers quick connectivity to a TV, but unfortunately only works at a maximum 1080p FHD resolution.

If you travel frequently or use public transportation and need to take this laptop with you on a daily basis, it may be a bit on the heavy side, so for me it is primarily a desktop replacement that you can move around the house and occasionally travel with.  The 360 degrees hinge makes this a versatile system that can easily switch between laptop modem, to tent to tablet mode that automatically disables the keyboard and touchpad.

All in all, I would recommend this to a friend as a productivity desktop replacement, content creator/editor and occasional light gaming system.",0.21352445426913516,Positive

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I got this computer to replace one that I purchased back in 2018.  It is a Dell 17 inch inspiring that externally looks very similar. I was fine with the 16 inch screen on thus because it is touch, and the 2 in 1 feature is nice, but I don't use my others much like that. It is built well, metal top and bottom and much more sturdy than my old device, weight wise, about the same.  The screen is crisp colors are good, says hdr enabled, and touch is very responsive.  The touchpad works ok with this, like my old one, but 95% of the time i use an external mouse (bluetooth and usb dongle, i have tried both with this so far, both work well, quick pairing) This has ample usb and usb-c connections, and an SD card Reader. I will miss the built in optical drive, I like being able to watch movies and not lug an external drive either me, I will have to now (as well as purchase dvd software).  Unfortunately that's the way all systems I tried to build are.   The keyboard layout us good, the backlight helps in the evenings typing.  The video camera and mic work well for video conferencing, and the sound us quite adequate.  This unit is mainly used for word processing, and simple games (solitare, slots, roblox) occasionally, and is more than enough. It also gets a ton of internet time.  So far it easily makes it through 8 hours of intermittent use during a workday, but I have nit ran it completely dead, only to about 20%. It has very adequate ram (16gb) and storage (1tb ssd).  I have not experienced bog, or lag on anything yet. The start up is very quick.   It also runs fairly cool on the lap when used like that.  It almost a twin for the one I'm replacing, just 6 years newer, ssd instead of standard hard drive, and no optical drive. My old one has Intel optane memory that made it start faster than standard laptops of the time, now this computer is all ssd and same fast access.  For a solid daily use computer for non gaming, this solidly checks all the boxes and a fair value.  I have to give it a solid 5 stars, nothing on it that I would deduct stars for on it’s part.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"At home, or in the office, most people will never push the Dell - Inspiron 16 7640 hard enough to demonstrate the full power it has available.  With a respectable (but not “Gaming Fast) 16” FHD touch display with Webcam, it’s certainly capable of running Engineering or Architectural Design Programs like SolidWorks or Revit. This computer will give you years of use. If the Feature details below are too technical, you can just be sure they are VERY impressive especially for a Laptop.

Features:
- Core Ultra 7 155H CPU
- 16” Touch Display with Intel ARC Graphics, Built-in microphone, and Web-cam
- Flexible Hinge allows the screen and keypad to be bent backwards so the 7640 can be used like a flat tablet, or the screen can be propped up securely on a surface like an airplane tray.
- 16 Gb of Dual Channel, DDR5 6400MHz RAM (soldered in place, therefore not expandable)
- 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe Solid State Drive (very compact, very fast, relatively cool running), (can be replaced by up to a 2 TB drive)
- Wireless AX+ Bluetooth
- 1 SD Card Reader Slot
- 2 USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A Ports
- 1 Thunderbolt 4 Port (with DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery)
- 1 HDMI 1.4 Port
- Charges through a standard USB 3 port rather than a proprietary dedicated port.
- Backlit Keyboard.


PROS:

- The NVMe hard drive gives fast bootup and transition speeds between programs.  Its 1 TB size can be doubled with a screw-driver by most DIY users.

- The Backwards-Bending hinge makes the Dell 7640 good for small sales presentations or training sessions.

- The touchscreen makes it a good tablet-device too.

- Considering its power, it’s thin and light.


CONS:

- RAM is not upgradable.

- Because I travel on business a lot, I turn the laptop on when I have even a short time to do some work between flights.  For some reason Dell chose on this 7640 not to include a camera good enough to enable Windows-Hello facial recognition.  This means that instead of coming to life as soon as you open the laptop and show it your face, you have to go through the tedious manual password typing startup or fumbling for the fingerprint reader.

- To save battery on my other laptops, I like the option of being able to hit the function keys to turn the screen fully dark when I have to take a short break.  For some reason, the Dell designers decided to only let you adjust the screen dimmer, but never fully off.

Conclusion:
Again, this laptop is not designed for AAA gaming performance, but if you just type emails and cruise the internet, or work with graphic applications like SolidWorks Engineering, Revit or Photoshop that don’t require blazing response times, then this one deserves your serious consideration.",0.15483333333333332,Positive

After transferring and loading my programs and getting the settings to my own personal preference, here's what I think:
Very impressed with the speed of this laptop. Once you start the laptop, you're on the main page in about 20 seconds and all programs are fully loaded.  The key placement on the keyboard are in the best spot. Normally, I have to adjust my typing on a new keyboard, but no typos while typing on this laptop so far. The 16"" touchscreen is the perfect size for being a home or business laptop.
There are two thunderbolt USB-C ports, two USB-A ports (one on each side), one HDMI port, one SD card port and 3.5 headphone jack.
The laptop also comes with Windows 11 and McAfee anti-virus preloaded.
Once connected to the Wi-fi, the laptop loads pages very quickly. No issues with connection so far.
What impresses the most so far is the battery life. I intentionally left it unplugged overnight and the battery held a good charge and was nowhere near being depleted.

This laptop isn't meant for hard core gamers, but it's perfect for browsing, watching videos, typing papers and playing music.

It feels very quick, quicker than a similarly configured ASUS machine actually.  The keys have a rubbery feel as opposed to plastic.  I find it very pleasant to type on.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"This is a really great work /study computer.  

One thing I liked about it right off the bat is that the screen is nice and big.  Because it is a touch screen, sometimes my big fat fingers have issues clicking the right buttons if the screen is too small.  Its also decently powerful and can handle quite a bit in photoshop and elements.  I was able to do quite a bit in both programs without running into any issues or feeling like the computer dragged too much.

I did try to game on it a bit and it works fine for any web based games, lighter games like minecraft, as well as older games like StarCraft 2.  Putting on newer stuff worked too, but the image settings were a bit lower.  That’s to be expected since it doesn’t have the best graphics chips in it.  I wouldn’t use this for a full on gaming computer, but if you took it to college and wanted to do some light gaming on it, it  would work great.

The speakers were a bit disappointing as I expected a bit better from the specs.  Its still really pretty good and clear, but the max volume wasn’t as loud as I expected.  Since I use headphones most of the time, this isn’t a big deal.

Install was also surprisingly easy.  I’ve been really annoyed recently with the bloatware and required user accounts just to get your computer running.  This still had all of that, but it felt like it didn’t try so hard to prevent you from skipping or working around it.

I do really like the fingerprint scanner, since for work or school the computer is getting closed and logged into a lot and its just so much faster and easier.  It also hast the built in webcam cover so you can be sure that even if something happened and your camera gets turned on by accident, you know it won’t show anything embarrassing.  This is a real  must have for me to send with a college kid who may have a one bedroom apartment where they change clothes in view of the computer.

I did notice that it takes quite a bit more power than I expected.  The charger is 100w USBc Charger while other standard USBc chargers I have are 60w.  In fact my stand alone higher watt USBc charging station is only 90w since that was enough for nearly every laptop that had charging by USBc.  Most other laptops I have that need more than 90w have a non-USB charger.  If you plug in anything less than 100w into it, even if you have nearly full power, this computer will do the stupid Dell “we’re slowing everything down to protect you and your computer, but really we’re trying to force you to buy our genuine more expensive replacement charger” scam.  Its annoying, but it will actually charge off of a 90w or 60w charger.  So if you don’t need the power or speed you can just run it and let it slow charge while plugged into a lower watt charger, or in if you really need the speed you can let it charge at a slow rate until you have enough to work for a while, then  you can unplug it and run at full speed off battery power, rinse and repeat as necessary.  Annoying, but still not as bad as a lighting port.

It did work fine with my dell docking station, even though it is older and designed for lower powered UCBc laptops, but I think technically the power block for the station is 120w so if you have a dock you should be ok with it even if its a bit older.

Overall this is a great college or work computer.  I would recommend this for pretty much anyone but someone looking for a serious gaming machine.",0.11936198721913002,Positive
Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I am totally impressed with this 2:1 laptop.  A computer that can replace my standard desktop, and be used as a Tablet/Tv.

This core I7, 16 thread laptop sports a single cpu speed of 4.5 gigahertz according to my estimates, it states it reaches 4.8 but it's still stronger than my 2009 home-made desktop, which I've overclocked, SSD based, modified Windows 10 with all the bloatware crippled or removed.
This machine runs with all the bloatware of windows 11 including negligible features that aren't even necessary to be running in the background. The sheer power of this machine is finally worthy of meeting my 2009 needs and then some.

It is both a reasonable portable tablet as well as full blown laptop and in many people's circumstances an easy replacement for your average desktop.

No one needs the power that I push my computers to doing stocks, checking, auctions sifting through social media using a homegrown AI, downloading TV shows and removing commercials and uploading them back to my DVR to watch television in peace without all the nonsense.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I’ve had other Dell laptops at home over the years, and my company provides a Dell for work. Every one of them has been a great workhorse. So far, this 16” Inspiron is my favorite.
It’s a little bigger and heavier than some, but it’s still quite portable and fits easily in my backpack. The large, beautiful screen is completely worth the extra size and weight in my opinion. I also have a portable monitor that I carry with me that’s just slightly smaller than the laptop. But with that addition, I have a fully functional home office setup with plenty of screen real-estate wherever I go.
The battery life has been great so far, although most of the time I use it while plugged in. The built-in speakers sound really good and are plenty loud when you need to turn up the volume. The keyboard isn’t anything special, but I found it to be easy to use. The track pad space is pretty large, so I did find myself accidentally touching it sometimes while typing. Most of the time I have a Bluetooth mouse connected, though, so I just updated the Windows settings to disable the touchpad when a mouse is connected. 
It comes with all the ports I’ve needed so far. There are two USB-C Thunderbolt ports on the left side. That lets me plug in power, and also connect my external monitor with both power and the video output in the same USB-C cable. It has a USB-A port and a regular HDMI port on the left side. Then on the right side, there’s another USB-A port, headphone jack, and an SD card reader slot. 
I have only one nitpicky complaint about the laptop, and that’s how the screen/lid is hinged. When it’s sitting flat and you open the screen up to a good viewing angle, it lifts the back of the laptop off the surface slightly. It doesn’t really cause any problem, but it just felt weird until I got used to it. Actually, maybe it’s even a good thing for improving air flow underneath for cooling.

The computer is average or adequate in its actions for an everyday user.   Body of the laptop construction quality is above average looking and feeling.    Screen is bright and nice size for people with older eyes.    It has an i7 Ultra processor with up to 22 logical processors.

I was not impressed with performance.   It was just there and did as it could, but not remarkable in any way.

One thing that was interesting is that the computer was evidently made 4/09/2024 and that is when the warranty started even though it did get powered on by me for initial boot until 4/24/2024.

Dell,Dell i7640-7366BLU-PUS,"I've been using this 2 in 1 laptop for the past week and it is a great everyday computer. It's got a nice, sleek look with the metal chassis that shows as silver in most light, but you get a glance of ice blue at different angles. It's pretty cool and makes the computer feel more premium. The speaker grills border the sides of the keyboard and produce decent sound considering the size and limitations.

Screen size is exactly what I wanted to replace a 6+yr old 17"" 2 in 1. Anytime you get above 15"" screens, weight starts to become more of a factor. For a 16"" laptop, this Dell is relatively light weight, which is impressive considering the metal body. The screen is crisp and works well in any light. In my use the computer never got excessively hot or loud from fans running. It has 2 USB C; 2 USB A; 1 HDMI; 1 SD card slot and a headphone jack. The charging cable is USB C, so be aware that one of the 2 ports will be needed for power during longer sessions. 

Overall, the only thing I wish this laptop had is a full number keypad. If the speakers were placed elsewhere, I think there's enough room for it.

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"BOTTOM LINE: The HP OmniBook X Flip-14” is an excellent mid-range laptop with a foldable display, plus it’s light and thin.  The Touchscreen is responsive in any position and appears bright and colorful indoors.  The new Ryzen AI5 340 Processor is fast while conserving battery life.  Although the SSD is only 512GB’s, it is more than adequate for most users.  The laptop’s “Achille’s Heel” is the glare-prone glossy screen.  

RATING: An easy 4-Stars this laptop earned itself primally for speed, battery conservation, lightweight portability, and the ability to fold in different positions.  But I would be hesitant to recommend this laptop to a friend only due to the glaring glossy display.  If you are not concerned by the glare, then by all means, go for it!  


TL; DR

DISPLAY: There is always a counterbalance with a display’s ability to provide a bright screen while not producing glare.  Manufactures can choose less bright screens, with a lower NITS value, and then compensate by using a glossy screen.  I always prefer a matte-display with a higher NITS valve for display viewability that does not distract the user. 

As much as I wanted to bond with this laptop’s display, the glare I encounter was just too significant for me to recommend to others.  Once you see glare, it never really gets better unless you are in total darkness or view from a distance beyond its intended use.  And setting up for “Dark Mode” to save battery life, only makes it worse, when the majority of the black display areas appear mirror-like.  If you enjoy viewing your ghostly reflections while working, you’ll be in ecstasy. 

On the positive side, viewing at certain angles, the display is very colorful and bright.  Indoors I would adjust the brightness to around 70 to 75% intensity which was perfectly suitable for viewing while conserving battery life.  Outdoors at 100% intensity, the screen is visibly washed out and unreadable.  Finally, using in our screened in porch, during daylight hours at 100%, was usable.  

FOLDING SCREEN: This “2-in-1” design is not new; my wife was using one 10 years ago.  Now beyond using as a standard laptop, using in an A-Fame (tent) configuration certainly has numerous benefits. Examples: Drawing, slideshow, cool video playback, etc.  And flipping the display all the way around will allow you to lay this laptop flat, unobstructed from the keyboard, to easily use an optional stylus/pen for your artwork, painting, or just doodling.  Note that the right-side edge of the laptop has a magnetic pen attachment area that holds the recommended optional pen (HP USB-C Rechargeable MPP2.0 Tilt Pen). 

Nevertheless, I did not feel flipping the display all the way around in “Sudo-Tablet” mode was useful.  Issue being, holding while feeling the keyboard keys inadvertently depressed, made it nothing like using a solid-back tablet.  Now if there is a case or folio that could shield the keyboard in tablet mode, that could work. 

KEYBOARD: It took me a while to appreciate this keyboard due to the limited separation between the keys and soft touch keys.  But after a few days I was fine and it’s currently a non-issue.  The backlighting keys are satisfactory and functional when required, although not the brightness even at their highest setting.  

MEMORY: OK, 16GB may well be more than sufficient for now, and hopefully future use.  However, I would prefer to have 32GB onboard and would be willing to buy and replace myself.  Researching LPDDR memory, it is not modular, it is embedded.  Meaning it has to be soldered directly onto the motherboard for speed and efficiency.  Another design technology trade-off.   Bottom line: Memory is not upgradable. 

Using the current version of Windows 11 Home 24H2, running MS Edge with 5 open tabs, listening to my iTunes M4A’s using Media Player, with an open Excel spreadsheet, while typing this review in Word, Task Manager showed 58% memory use from 41% after a clean bootup.  So just maybe 16GB will be all I will ever require. 

HP SOFTWARE: I’m assuming that the current trend for Next Gen Ai, Recall, Copilot, etc. processing requires unique and dedicated applications.  After firing up this laptop, and after the numerous system updates, I jumped over to Settings/Apps/Install Apps for a peak.  Hmmm, there are 13 HP Applications; actually 14 when including the myHP app buried further down the list.  Normally I would uninstall what I consider bloatware but will decline to do so only because I am no longer confident which apps are actually needed.  

Finally, I believe two of the HP application could be married into one. The “HP Support Assistant” and “myHP” both providing HP support type information and options.  Having to open and manage two apps for HP features, both with login’s, is just silly.     

BATTERY LIFE: Excellent!  No doubt the AMD Rysen Ai-5 340 wizardry, coupled with the embedded 65-watt 3-cell lithium-ion polymer battery, is marketed to provide up to 19.5 hours of advertised video playback.  No, I have not seen the 19+ hrs. but have experience over 13 hours of actual laptop use with 20% remaining.  

I will also mention this HP Laptop, using the myHP app, provides access to “Battery Manager - Maximize Battery Health”. That reduces charging the battery to an 80% level for extending its lifespan.  (This is not a Window’s feature but requires a manufacturer application or BIOS setting.)  

SUNDRY FEATURES: High-speed USB 40Gpbs PD Port. IR camera for Facial Recognition (Windows Hello) with mechanical camera block out switch.  Solid WiFi 6e connectivity.  A HDMI 2.1 port.  Radeon 840 graphics.  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Screen.  And a 65-watt USB Type-C power adapter.  

MANUALS: PDF’s can be found on HP’s web site (User Guide & Maintenance).  It would be helpful if there were links to all of the required Documents found in Best Buy’s site under “From the Manufacturer”.  Currently, there is only a combined “Brochure - Data Sheet” available there.

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"The grey “clam” case design seems well constructed with sturdy hinges. At 3.11 lbs., it is heavier than I expected but still light enough to make it easy to travel with as does the 2 in 1 design and the Gorilla Glass 3 screen. It should more than meet your work, light gaming and streaming needs. 

Impressions;

It comes with AMD Ryzen AI 300 series processor with NPU and 16 meg of L3 cache and AMD Radeon 840M graphics. This combination is nice for pretty much any business app or day-to-day processing you might use as well as light gaming. I loaded up Minecraft Java edition and had my grandsons have at it and they had no issues. But heavy gaming really isn’t an option born out by my PCMark10 and 3Dmark test scores.

I am a huge fan of 13/14 inch laptops. They are just the right size for traveling and fits easily on the seat tray, even when the seat in front is reclined. 

16GB LPDDR5X 7500megahertz memory. Faster than I have in my gaming desktop I built 2 years ago.

WD PC SN5000S SDEPNSJ-512G-1006 M.2 SSD. It tested as fast as its specs state using Crystaldiskmark 8.0.6 x64. But why not go with 1TB - the cost must be minimal. Not sure how easy it might be to update by opening the laptop. I updated my drive several years ago on an HP laptop and it was easy. Would be easier to accept if had mico-sd option.

Wi-Fi 6e. That’s fast, but why not 7?

LED IPS screen is good at 1920 x 1200 with better colors and viewing angle than I expected but still prefer OLED. At 400 nits laptop will only stream HDR, not natively. Touch sensitivity is very good. The screen is a tad more reflective than I like, which may be in part due to Gorrilla Glass 3 being used? Changing angle always helps.

The back-lit keyboard is nice size with very large lettering. On/off is top right of keyboard which I like as it makes it hard to accidentally turn off laptop, but it is where the delete key is normally. It does have a small light which is always on which helps to remind you. Function key also has a small light that is always on as well. The touchpad is a nice size and tracks well. Overall, I liked the tactile feel.

The sound, using 2 Poly Studio speakers, is impressive. I could not find exact watts, but the speakers seem to be mounted on the very front of the laptop under the keyboard area (2 little slits). It has good volume, and the sound seems to envelop you. 

Left side connections are 1 USB 4 (40gbps), 1 USB-C 3.1 (10gbps), 1 USB-A 3.1 (10gbps) and 1 HDMI 2.1. Can charge from either USB-C but would have liked one on the right side to allow charging from either side. I transferred a 7GB movie file from a Samsung T7 M.2 external ssd in under 10 seconds, using any of the USB connections. I connected a 4K monitor using HDMI connection and finally got it setup to stream 4K at 60Hz. Using Windows 11 monitor settings was difficult to setup, and I don’t know if it might be due to me being unfamiliar with how AMD video works. I will say I tried to access Omen Gaming Hub – and it froze every time so not impressed with it.

Right side connections include another USB-A (10gbps) as well as combined headphone/microphone jack.

Camera has a manual slide to cover it – which is an excellent idea.

3 cell Lithium-ion polymer battery. I looped a 1080P movie with balanced power, Bluetooth on using wireless headphones and wi-fi off and after 8 hrs. I had 16% battery left – which is good in my book, but nowhere near the 19 hours mentioned.

No micro SD card reader 

No Finger print reader.

1-year warranty


This laptop seems to be sturdy and can handle any day-to-day processing needs as well as light gaming. It’s a tad heavier than I would like and does not have OLED screen. But I would be happy to use it and recommend it at 4 stars.",0.24306858564321254,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I found the HP OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1 - Copilot+ PC - 14"" 2K Touch-Screen Laptop with AMD Ryzen AI 5 processor to be a very solid performer and quite capable for most laptop tasks. Its 16GB Memory of fast 7500 Mhz RAM and 512GB SSD provide plenty of horsepower and snappy performance for office productiviity software like Microsoft Office 365.  The onboard AMD Radeon 840M graphics powers a bright 1920x1200 display, very appropriate for a 14-inch display.  Another great feature is the lighted keyboard which is almost a necessity for laptop computers these days.

As stated in the model's name, the HP OmniBook can be used as a tablet and the mechanism to change to a tablet is as simple as flipping over the screen and voila, it’s a tablet. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass, so you know it can hold up to some abuse and suitable for using a stylus with the touch screen.

Battery life it excellent as I ran the laptop for over 7 hours and the battery percentage only dropped from about 90% to around 60%, granted it did sleep for some of that time.  Recharging is quick using the included charger plugged into a USB-C port for convenience.

I think what I really like most about this laptop is the simple clean and thin case design, along with the easy conversion to a tablet, making it a versatile and easily portable laptop for most laptop users’ needs.  The laptop seems to have ample ventilation and not once could I detect any kind of heat in use. Software installation of Microsoft Windows 11 went smoothly, albeit with several downloads and restarts to complete the process.
  
Again, the HP OmniBook offers a very comprehensive laptop with an overall clean design, good battery life, and snappy performance, all wrapped in a stylishlty simple yet sturdy metal case and tough scratch-resistant screen.",0.29175627240143365,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I couldn't help but smile when I opened up the box for this laptop. I was really impressed with the feel and build quality of this laptop. It looks and feels quite premium. Most of the chassis seems to be made of metal, aluminum perhaps. It is chunky, has some weight to it and is cold to the touch. I may be wrong, it is really hard to tell. But I feel like the top and bottom of the laptop is plastic. I only say that because it is lighter than it looks. I can't find information on the materials used in this laptop, either way.. it looks and feels great! It feels like it is built to last. The screen is very glossy, 14"" and seems to be an IPS panel. The screen, in my opinion is the weakest thing about this laptop. The viewing angles aren't great, colors looked a little washed out when viewed from the side, and there is sight backlight bleed / IPS glow in certain situations. Contrast ratio is not the greatest, blacks also look more grey than true black and the screen seems to be capped at 60hz. I feel like laptops should come standard with a 120hz refresh rate. It is not a deal breaker by any means, but it's 2025 and having at least a 120hz refresh rate will make a laptop feel so much better. Especially when scrolls through web pages and applications. It is not the worst screen I've seen on a laptop, but I wish it was better. This laptop is very classy and beautiful. It needs a beautiful screen to match. 

The AMD Risen AI 5 with Radeon 840M integrated GPU feels quick and snappy. It can handle day to day tasks like photo editing, video editing. It can also handle light gaming. I was able to play rocket league, and Ninja Turtles - Shredders revenge without a hitch. It is definitely not a gaming laptop, I experienced serious frame drops when I tried playing more modern AAA titles, but it can handle some games. They'll probably run better at a medium / low settings at 720p/1080p resolutions.

The Ryzen ""Ai"" chips are new to the Market, at least this is the first I've heard of them. They have a dedicated ""neural"" processing chip for Ai tasks. I'm intrigued to see where this will go, if it's anything like other Ai chips I've researched, I assume they will learn and improve at completing tasks as they go. AMD has always been a favorite chip maker of mine, and the processor in this computer is very impressive. It really sips on battery while performing some intense tasks. Ive been using it daily for about a week, and I've only had to charge it once so far. 

The built in speakers are located on the bottom of this laptop, ( a weird choice) but they still sound very good. The laptop folds all the way back and you can lay it flat with the screen up, or set it up like a tent. So having the speakers on the bottom of the laptop makes sense when you take advantage of the adjustable screen. 

Speaking of Ai.. HP's Ai assistant is kind of meh.. It feels more like bloatware and is redundant. This laptop comes with Microsoft Copilot, a Microsoft Ai assistant which is easier to use and more polished than HP's Ai assistant. Copilot is helpful for daily tasks, but it also needs some polishing and refining. To me, it feels more like a glorified search bar. The ai assistant in this machine is kind of limited for now, perhaps Microsoft will improve it in the near future. But for now, I don't find it to be too useful. I would rather load up a google search bar for finding and doing what I need to do. 

Overall, I really enjoy using this laptop. It is great for productivity.. work from home, media consumption and light gaming. The AMD chip in this laptop is the best thing about it, it is so efficient with battery while being very snappy. I hate to give it a 4 star review, because it is so close to being an excellent laptop, but because of how unimpressed I am by the screen on this machine, I have to dock a star and give it a 4 out of 5. Would I recommend this laptop? I'll say yes, but only if you absolutely need and want to have a laptop that can fold completely flat, and can stand like a ""tent"". It is classy, lightweight, and performs well while being very battery efficient.

Pros: Classy Design

         Plenty of Ports. 2x USB C, 2 USB A, a full size HDMI and 3.5mm Aux port. 
 
         The new AMD Ryzen Ai chip is quick, snappy and battery efficient

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"HP didn't disappoint with this premium laptop. This is one of the best laptops I've felt. The all-metal design is sturdy. It feels solid and not like some thin aluminum. That was the first thing I noticed. I'm not sure what coating HP is using. This device doesn't absorb fingerprints like some other devices.

Pros
-All Metal-Premium Design
-Thunderbolt 4 port, USB-C (10GB) port, and 2 USB-A (10GB) ports
-Lightweight Package that can be easily put into a bag
All day battery Life at 60% Screen Brightness, I was able to get over 15 Hours of online video playback
-A Good Everyday Processor that will get the basic needs and some basic content creation done
-A Quiet Laptop, Not once did I ever hear the fans ramp up
-The Keyboard (Subjective) has very short travel, and I mean short, but the clicks were satisfying 
-16GB of RAM and 500GB of Storage (I would like to see 24GB of RAM)

Again, I can't get over how nice this laptop feels. The speakers get loud even though they fire down. The Omnibook X Flip has set the standard for me for Windows Laptops. There is one flaw, however. This is where I feel like the mark was slightly missed.

Negative
-HP cheaped out on the screen. The screen is clear and crisp, but its colors are not 100% accurate. This may be a turn-off for some creators. You made such an elegant laptop. You even gave it a glossy screen, which is ideal for a two-in-one. I'm even fine with the 1920x1200. Yet, the color accuracy was missed.
-Also, no laptop in 2025 should come with McAfee... Uninstall this NOW! HP has a lot of ""bloatware"" that comes with the device. There is so much ""HP"" this and that. Why did my device come with HP's gaming software installed? This is not a gaming laptop... The bloatware needs to stop...
-AI... AI... AI... I don't care about the AI because it's nowhere near as good on laptops. Feels like HP is shoving it in our faces...
-RAM not upgradable but the SSD is

Even with the negatives, this is a great laptop. It is suitable for an everyday laptop, a school laptop, or a business laptop. You get everything that you need to get your work done. Lightweight and portable with enough ports to be used as a home work station! Just relax on the bloatware HP...",0.18903903903903904,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"Overall it’s a good system that combines a nicely multi-functional screen, great battery life, and enough power to run any application you need for utility. It’s probably not quite what you’d want for super intensive tasks like photoshop due to the standard resolution screen and matte appearance, but from a business and common use standpoint it hits the mark. I was super interested to see the keyboard setup as they are very squared and inset against each other. It provided fairly good tactile feedback and I was able to easily type like normal.

The 180 degree screen is the biggest star although I definitely wished an active stylus had come with it and is it just lends itself to use for tablet style input. It’s an available accessory though so easy to overcome.

Other item of note is the usb-c plug was fairly hard to get inserted but I attribute that to the thinness overall, probably just has very tight tolerances to slip in. If you experience any issues, just know it does fit.

Overall appreciate the portability, power, and battery life which makes it super suitable for work, school, and other such utility use cases.",0.18256528417818743,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I wanted to take as much time as I could with this new HP notebook computer before providing a review. This came mostly from wanting to make sure I understood the AI companion component or the offering. 

Let me start with the basics first. This HP comes with pretty solid specs for the home user, and offers the added benefit of a full flip touchscreen for those who prefer to interact that way. It handled all of my usual tasks with ease and the screen was very crisp when not getting hit by glare. 

Where I found myself questioning the usefulness was the AI companion concept. For those who know absolutely nothing about the variety of AI engines out there, I suppose this could be a starting place. But given Windows has copilot built in, I couldn’t find myself going into the companion app to do things it would already do with simple prompting. In my experiences this functionality added additional steps for users who already know what they are doing. 

The one part of the AI companion i did find useful was the “perform” tab which gave system specific information and allowed you to give prompts like “make the camera follow my face” and get to a quicker answer than clicking around aimlessly in the settings. 

All in all I’d say it’s a great computer for the price from a system standpoint but I wouldn’t let the allure of the “AI companion” be a specific draw unless you know nothing about, nor want to learn about, AI prompting via the most popular engines.",0.23806818181818185,Positive

USE
The HP OmniBook has plenty of power for most any day-to-day task whether it be work or pleasure.  The AMD Ryzen 5 AI processor has a total of 6 cores.  3 Performance and 3 Economy Cores.  Unlike its Intel counterpart, the AMD cores all support multiple threads.  I was able to stream full HD video while still preparing documents and having multiple browser tabs open in the background.  Rarely did it bog down or feel burdened.  Combined with a respectable 16GB or RAM and Radeon 840M Graphics, the OmniBook has plenty of reserve power for most any need.  Even during my most demanding parts of the day, overall memory utilization rarely topped 50%.  CPU utilization varies wildly from minute to minute, but even with everything mentioned above, the Ryzen 5 never lost its cool and remained quiet the entire day.  It was a pleasant surprise.

The backlit keyboard is a nice addition when using the OmniBook as a traditional laptop.  This day and age, I would not consider a 2-in-1 or any other laptop for that matter without a backlit keyboard.  Unfortunately, this same keyboard isn’t the best.  Its actuation feels cheap and the keys have no texture to easily differentiate one from another.  Competitors’ laptops have far better keyboards.

With a resolution of just 1920 x 1200, the 14-inch screen is still clear, and the font is legible and smooth.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  Combined with the Corning Gorilla Glass, it makes for a tough, clear display.

CONS
The biggest drawback of the OmniBook is the included bloatware.  The biggest offender is McAfee anti-virus.  It is an unnecessary and resource hungry program.  In addition, the Omnibook ships with several other programs to try and make video conferencing look and sound much better.  Programs like Poly Camera Pro, Windows Studio Effects, and other HP “Optimization” programs add up to a taxing demand on the CPU.  If you use your OmniBook for video conferencing, WFH, etc. you may find that these programs are very beneficial, especially the AI noise reduction.  For me, I rarely use video conferencing, so they were unnecessary, and with them always starting up by default, they used up precious system resources, bogging the system down forcing me to manually deactivate them.

Speakers.  The sound quality of the speakers is quite good.  I found them to be some of the better speakers I’ve used on a laptop.  The HP audio tuning works well and the inclusion of DTS audio processing makes them that much better.  The problem is that they fire downward.  They work great when using the OmniBook as a laptop with the sound bouncing off your desk to your ears, but when used as a tablet, the audio is pointed away from you.  Not ideal.

While HP touts “All Day” performance from the OmniBook.  I found myself averaging about 5 hours of constant use before reaching for a charger.  This is at 50% screen brightness and video streaming nearly the entire time.

FINAL THOUGHTS
The HP OmniBook offers a lot in a small package.  It’s nowhere near the lightest or most powerful laptop on the market, but it strikes a nice balance.  Enough processing power, memory, and storage to be a useful device for years to come.  

I would still like to have better actuation from the keyboard without the buttons feeling cheap and fragile and I would absolutely love to see HP stop using the often troublesome MediaTek Wi-Fi card, but the OmniBook is still a good laptop and worthy of a look if you are in the market for a 2-in-1, especially if used for teleconferencing and WFH scenarios.

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"The HP OmniBook X Flip 14” laptop is one premium computer that can definitely complete with that other computer which is named after a fruit. Its specs and features are something to brag about. First this is a touch screen laptop that can be flipped so that it can be used as a tablet and can also be setup in tent mode which is good for presentations. This I emphasize as the other brand still has not been able to do this for whatever reason. And like tablets, this computer boasts a battery life of 14 hours or so. Being that this is still new, I wasn’t able to verify this myself.

Its screen can compete with other tablets and premium computers as it has a glossy Corning Gorilla glass 400 nit display which has a resolution of 16:10 which I must say a bit odd. Its gray metal finish definitely screams premium and by no means exagerates itself. But what sets this apart is that this is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series processors. Independent benchmarks this as one huge performer. And while it is still too early to really find out, this laptop is AI enabled having a 50 TOPS npu where other PCs only have a maximum of 40 TOPS. And to add gravy to this laptop, this is further powered by a Radeon 840M gpu which is quite fast for an integrated gpu.

Other features of this laptop is that it has dual cameras which can be used for facial recognition. And mind you the cameras are quite sharp. As for memory this laptop has 16GB DDR5 RAM and a 512GB MVME M.2 SSD. Pretty much decent nowadays. It has two 10GBPS USB-A ports, a 10GBPS USB-C port and a 40GBPS type C port. Definitely capable.

As for the software, there is miminal bloatware pre-installed with the exception of McAfee anti-virus and HP utilities. Of course, this has Windows 11 but the home version as this is still a consumer laptop.

That said, I have nothing more to comment since the specs pretty much speak for themselves. And also, laptops have been around for decades that it has been a matter of specs alone. All I can further say is that this is a good buy and I recommend this for others.",0.1478787878787879,Positive

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"The backlit keyboard has a decent feel to it, with positive feedback when a key is pressed.  Not overly noisy either.  My biggest complaint is that the Home and End keys are not dedicated; you have to press the FN key first.  And in another oversight related to this, they decided to associate the ‘FN LOCK’ function to the left SHIFT key.  So, if you want to execute a SHIFT+HOME/END, you have to make sure you press & hold the SHIFT key first, followed by FN, and then HOME/END. If you get the timing wrong and press FN first, then you’ll engage/disengage the FN LOCK instead.  Very poor design.  I’m probably in the minority, but I use those Home/End frequently, and it drives me nuts that they aren’t dedicated.

My next minor complaint is that the USB-C ports are only on the left side of the laptop.  They have USB-A ports on both sides, so I’m not sure why they thought putting all of the USB-C ports on the same side made sense.  I see this on many laptops, but it’s still annoying.

Non-Microsoft bloatware is kept relatively in check.  Half a dozen or so HP utilities, which mostly stay out of your way unless you open them yourself, Adobe, some kind of Dropbox promotion, and McAfee security.

The camera has a physical privacy shutter, so that’s a plus.

The front edge of the laptop, where your wrists likely rest, is smooth.  Some other laptops have a hard edge that can be irritating.

Battery life is pretty good.  I was able to stream music for about 6 hours and still had 15-20% life left.

Although I don’t use tablet mode often, it appears that HP took it into consideration with the overall design.  Whereas many manufacturers are going for the smallest display bezel possible, the Flip is designed with just enough of a bezel that you can effectively hold the ‘tablet’ in one hand and interact using the other.  If the bezel were any smaller, you might run into issues with your holding hand inadvertently interacting with the display.  That said, it is a tad on the heavy side if you plan on frequently using it in tablet mode.

Overall it’s a decent unit.  Would probably make a nice laptop for school due to the size and tablet versatility.  But the poor way they handled the Home/End functionality is a fault in my view.",0.048282828282828275,Neutral
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This 2-in-1 laptop from HP is top tier! I use it for work and college so it pretty much hits all the marks for me. Laptop when I need it to type, or tablet when I'm just relaxing and want to watch a show or something. It's versatile and can fit into any category with zero limitations software-wise. Speaking of software, this thing runs smoothly. I've had zero issues, no lagging, no overheating, and the touch screen is super responsive. 

Battery life is as advertised and lasts the whole day on one charge. From work, I can go straight to class and have battery to spare by the time I get home. Granted, I still bring my charger with me just in case I work on something power-intensive. Better safe than sorry haha. Furthermore, I quite enjoy the build quality. It's sleek and feels like it was built well. Plus, it's aesthetically pleasing. The resolution and screen quality are also great! I do wish it could get brighter, but I mostly use it indoors, so it's not too big of a problem. 

This is great for professional and academic work, especially since it comes with 16GB of RAM, and you can even game on it if you want to. It's not going to give you 4k at 120 FPS, but it can manage on low graphics settings.

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This laptop is extremely well built, yet very light, and looks and feels a lot like much more expensive unit. Its very thin, the hinges are solid, and it just feels good in the hands. 

 At first I didnt think the flip feature would be something I used or needed until I tried it. Being able to set the screen up at any angle makes a huge difference. Especially when viewing media. Although the screen is small it is very crisp and clear at 1920X1200. 

 Its plenty powerful for your daily use, but dont expect to be gaming here. And of course that isnt what this is made for. But with a Ryzen Ai 5, 512gb SSD, and 16GB of LPDDR5x ram this handles everything I need it to and then some. Tabs for days, extremely fast boot times make for a nice little workhorse that can go anywhere. 

 The claimed 19 hour battery life is of course under very light usage, but Ive had no problem getting through a day of average use. And it charges fairly quick as well. 

 The keyboard has a great feel with good feedback, and is backlit which is always a plus. Typing away at night without the need for a light is a nice touch. (Pun intended).

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This laptop is fun to use and carry around. Perfect for the on-the-go creator, producer, or writer.

I have Concerns about battery life. On one charge it holds for a good 8-10 hours. However after a week or so the charge hasn't been holding the charge for the same amount. Also while in laptop mode it gets uncomfortably hot in my lap. I can only use it on a desk. But in tablet mode it's fine.

All in all I'm happy with the laptop. I look forward to using AI to power my creativity.",0.40356060606060606,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This is a great laptop overall and even though there are some minor things that I think just boil down to user preference I'd recommend it as a laptop that would be great for school, work, casual use and entertainment on the go. It's not a gaming laptop with powerful discrete graphics and that's not why you'd get this one anyway as that's not what it's built for. However, it is powerful enough to play casual light graphics games which makes it all around a good general use laptop PC. 

INITIAL IMPRESSIONS: When unboxing this laptop you'll notice it's premium finish and look. It's really quite thin and light weighing a little over 3 pounds. The frame feels solid and the keyboard to me had the right feel along with the touchpad. Before turning it on, I love how this laptop looked and felt. 

INITIAL SETUP/UPDATES: 

The first boot up and configuration/setup only took a couple of minutes and asked only a few questions to get going after creating a user account or signing in with an existing Microsoft account. There are a lot of people that don't like this but that's more of a Microsoft thing than it is HP. That said, I do actually like it as it lets you bring your settings over from another PC or start fresh and with OneDrive it syncs you files and your account syncs passwords and sign in with Edge so it really is seamless if you use these services on your old laptop or desktop and don't want to worry about losing stuff or keeping it in sync.

Immediately, I uninstalled Mcaffee and wish HP would make that an optional thing you choose to install when you set up your machine. I tend to prefer Windows Defender, it works and is easy to use. Other antivirus software can be good if you use the other features but it's not something I need or use and I wish they'd give you a choice when you setup the computer rather than just have it pre-installed so it nags you or you have to uninstall it.

Once setup and the updates were done, which only took a few minutes I was up and going and even had Microsoft Office installed and everything synced from my other laptop. Microsoft and HP really makes this easy if you have used Microsoft Office 365 and OneDrive. Microsoft Edge remembered all of my passwords from my old machine and setup the face recognition and pin making it easy to get everything going on this one. 

PERFORMANCE/CAMERA/SOUND/KEYBOARD: 

In terms of performance, it's fast and there's plenty of memory for most standard office and entertainment tasks for lots of multi-tasking. The WiFi connection is solid and performs really quite well. The webcam and microphone is definitely tuned for virtual meetings and calls and HP bundled in AI software that uses AI and HDR to make you and your environment look you best so I'd say it'd even be good for someone who does a lot of content creation or streaming on the go. The sound on this laptop is pretty solid. It's loud and crisp but I felt like the bass was a little lacking. When turned up all the way the speakers don't distort and are on par with a tablet in terms of sound and quality but do fall short of sound from other laptops in terms of bass and more rounded out sound overall. Don't let that scare you though, it does sound good but just not up with the best that's out there. As for the keyboard, the keys have a nice feel to them and they are backlit which is nice when you are using it in a darker environment. 

DISPLAY: 
As for the display, you'll either love or hate it. I love that it's glass and Corning Gorilla glass, which does resist scrates and looks amazing but it does have the drawback of attracting a lot of glare so in bright rooms with windows or direct bright lights you may get glare on the screen that could be super annoying. That to me it wasn't that bad but I could definitely see some people having issues with that depending on the environment and preference. Aside to that, the colors and deep blacks on this screen do look great and pop, especially in a darker room. In bright rooms, you'll definitely benefit from turning up the brightness to counter the glare but at the expense of battery life. Perhaps HP will consider a glass with a glare reduction in future versions but I'm still happy with it overall. 

CONNECTIVITY:
You get WiFi, and Bluetooth and a few different ports, like a Thunderbolt port (1), USB A (1) and Type C (2) ports along with an HDMI. I would have much rather had another USB-C port and Type A port instead of the HDMI so you could use a USB-C to HDMI adapter and have more ports for general connectivity. That said, there is a enough here to do that too so that's just more a preference on my part.

AI:
Is the AI NPU worth it? I would say most definitely as a future proof tech. As more software supports it, you'll find yourself wanting or even needing this NPU hardware feature as some video and photo editing software packages even now require it in order to use certain editing features which not only are faster but really do enhance your workflow resulting in less work and the ability to do the processing locally rather than putting your data out there online in the cloud. Everyone is talking cloud AI today, but I believe it's a solid bet there'll be new suites of software in the future that specialize in using AI and NPUs on your PC locally rather than in the cloud because it's much cheaper being purpose built and doesn't require a dedicated set of cloud computers to run, and at the same time offers stronger privacy among other many other benefits and leaves the larger AI workloads (like training AI models) for the cloud for businesses and processes that need the additional power.

VERSATILITY:
I love that you can flip this laptop over, use it as a tablet and even draw or write with an optional stylus. It's all around a solid machine and one that I would expect from HP at this level. The design is refined and purpose driven with the only real issue being the glare on the display. Outside of that, it's solid and I'd recommend it.",0.17313503891372742,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"The HP Omni X flip offers great capability and Ai performance for those on the go, multi-tasking, facetiming, day to to day requirements that most face. While Ai co-pilot features are still a new design coming in to play, not all are built to the same quality. The Omnibook X Flip offers a glimpse in what a well designed Co-Pilot feature can offer.

Out of the box i have to say first and foremost i was very pleasantly surprised to how well designed the chassis is. Full light weight metal with almost zero torsion or flex. A well light back keyboard with a seamless track pad that never lost place of my finger strokes. After about an hour of charge time i decided to put the battery life to the test and see how long it would last and effect performance with the Ai built processor and Co-Pilot features. This is very first laptop i have ever owned that yielded me 30 hours of normal day to day routines. During that run time i never truly noticed any performance throttling. Ya, there was the diming of the keys and monitor but my Google meet calls ever experienced any issues. All video feeds were crystal clear with no drop outs or distortion. Even when sharing my screen, cpu performance remained at a solid 30% load.  While editing photos i noticed the Co-Pilot feature, which i had turned on, asked me if i wanted help cleaning up the photo. I allowed it to do its thing as most basic cell phones can do basic photo editing anyways. I honestly thought it would do a basic crop and move on but it changed quite a bit more. It cropped the person i was focusing on, cleaned up the lines and blurred out the background, while changing the lighting and color hues. Im assuming it was assuming this was the look i was going for (which i eerily was). The Omnibook also supports windows facially recognition and comes equipped with a beautifully flush window shutter for your lens. I actually didn't even know i had a privacy window at first due to it being that flush.

I tried to really focus on the Ai side to this laptop as this is a really new feature that is going to be present in pretty much everything. Im not a know it all but in my limited knowledge what a consumer needs to know is what makes a lap top a true Co-Pilot is a laptop with a NPU (neural processing unit). The basics of this feature is your now taking your computer and it no longer needs to use Ai from cloud servers but rather in a very basic sense it now has its own logic or built in Ai. Think of it as a brain for your laptop, hence the word neural. Now as far as day to day practicality here is what i noticed. It seemed like it did over ride and take control of other task i was no longer using allowing me to never notice a performance issue when not directly plugged into a power source. I like how when i get confused on what setting to go in to, it very easily guided me there and at times would perform the task i was gonna do anyways. The photo editing feature was cool for sure but still nothing stand out. I spend alot of time on Google Meet and often have to screen share for video presentations. For the most part with my other laptops i get the occasional flickering and diming of the light as the lens tries to focus and adjust. I'll get the random video stutter or when it really loads up i may even get reduced video quality that is being viewed by my other peers. With the OmniBook  i never once experienced any of these issues, not once! The one difference that stood out to me the most was the lighting. I would get distracted when my camera would start to dim my video feed as it would try to adjust to environment. This annoyed so much so that it was the first improvement i noticed with the Omnibook Co-Pilot.

Overall this is the future of computers and at this price point, it is a great way to test the waters. I didn't want to touch too much on the other features as they can easily be pulled from BestBuy but rather i wanted to try to stay on point with the subject at hand which is the current use of Co-Pilot features in feature laptops and PCs. And while its not perfect or ground breaking it can definitely be felt in the way of performance. For me im excited to see how this improves as time goes on.",0.1802232698808041,Positive

The timing was perfect when I recieved this offer... My wife's laptop had just died and I had given her one that did not have the touch-screen. The poor thing struggled mightily with the non-touch screen. I wouod look over and she would be whacking on the screen and getting frusturated because nothing was happening. I must have reminded her at least five times that the screen on this one was not going to work... She was so used to having the rtouch-screen that was just operating out of habit.

HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I've been a MacBook user since my college days because ever since I tried one in college, I fell in love with the sleek, premium aluminum build. Over the years, I came to accept that Windows laptops couldn't compete with that design. But little by little things are chaging, and more Windows laptops are stepping up. Honestly, my MacBook is starting to feel outdated especially now that so many laptops come with a touchscreen. I would be lying if I said that Apple will make a touchscreen MacBook in the future because of their obsession with keeping the iPad separate. Luckily, not all companies are greedy, and this is where the HP with its OmniBook X Flip 2 in 1 is making me leave my MacBook behind. 

This thing is a beauty. It looks sleek, feels premium, and perfectly blends laptop functionality with that of a tablet. When I need a laptop, it’s powerful and smooth. But when I want to chill, I just flip it over into tablet mode, and it’s perfect for reading or watching movies on the go. I freaking love it! I wish I could say a MacBook could do that, but it doesn’t. 

Personally, I like to do some light gaming from time to time, so I downloaded EAFC 25, and it runs flawlessly. Honestly, this 2 in 1 laptop does everything I need it to do. I won’t go as far as to say this HP OmniBook X Flip is making me switch to Android phones, but I will say it has moved me away from thinking I need to keep using my MacBook for my productivity. That’s a first for me in over 10 years. I never thought I'd see the day, but it’s here!",0.24981060606060604,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This small laptop is perfect for home use, light gaming, and my two preteen daughters are already using it for school work and play. It charges quickly and holds a charge for a good while. The flip feature to use it as a tablet is fantastic. The touch screen is responsive and smooth when using either a pen or a finger. Although I was disappointed that a pen was not included. 

The screen is bright and antireflective. I have really enjoyed using this in tablet mode like a a-frame to have a mobile tv that's larger than an average tablet. The only thing I thing I don't really is the speakers do not sound very good in this A-frame configuration. They sound very good for such a small laptop in regular laptop mode, and they sound good in tablet mode. But set up they way I like to stand it, they don't sound good at all. 

Other than those two small gripes (lack of an included pen and sound in a certain configuration), This laptop is a perfect at home of on the go computer for light to medium duty work.",0.2933102918586791,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This HP OmniBook X Flip 14 inch Laptop is a sturdy little computer that will handle day to day tasks with ease while throwing in a little bit of fun for the adventurous user. I know that the product description states 16 inch, however the laptop I received and am reviewing is the 14 inch variant.

When I was in college I had a flip laptop that I thought would be an amazing bridge between laptop and tablet/television and enjoyed it at first. However, I am not sure that the technology was quite there as the hinges eventually started to wear and the laptop broke in half. This is now the third HP laptop that ""flips"" into the tent or tablet configuration and I am convinced that HP has this figured out now. I have ZERO concerns that this laptop will have any problems with the hinges. So if that is something that causes you anxiety when you look at laptops, take a deep breath and relax!

Setup for the HP OmniBook X Flip was a little bit more cumbersome than other laptops I have had my hands on, but not by much and is definitely very doable for all skill sets. This is the first time that I have received a laptop with absolutely zero battery charge. Normally when I open the box the laptop is around 40-60% charged. Obviously plugging in the laptop is the first thing you want to do anyway, but I had to wait about 30 minutes for the laptop to charge enough to turn on. I would also recommend charging to 100% and/or running on AC power when you first set up this laptop as it needs to go through a fairly timely download/restart cycle when first powered on. Overall, probably took about 20 minutes of just letting the laptop do its thing.

Once setup, I ran though my basic routine for entertainment and business needs. Pulled up the email, went through my business suppliers weekly deals, made sure my calendar was accurate for the week, streamed music in the shop, and doom scrolled the social medias for a while. When I switched from business mode to boredom solving, I flipped the laptop into tent mode and found this feature and the touch screen as something I have sorely missed. When I finally found the motivation to be productive around the shop, I used the touchscreen and the flexibility of google to through my music to my workshop chromecast and was able to use the HP OmniBook X Flip as a controller for my tunes and videos. The touchscreen was amazingly accurate and responsive.

Overall, the hardware included in this computer really works well together. The operating system, the AMD Ryzen 5 CPU, the 16gb RAM, and the WiFi 6e chip have made my usage so for very smooth and enjoyable! Add onto that I have been using this laptop fairly intensely for the last 3 hours and the battery is currently at 69%. This usage includes stress testing, streaming, and everything that is known to kill batteries.

On the exterior, the HP OmniBook X Flip has 2 USBs, 2 USB-Cs, HDMI Out, and a headset jack. The USB-C ports are also used for charging, which seems to be the norm for laptops moving forward. I do regularly use an ethernet connection as I program networks and surveillance systems and I do wish this laptop came with an ethernet port, however I have a USB-Ethernet adapter (also available as Best Buy) that I carry in my work bag for this purpose.

If you are looking for a business or student laptop that can also handle entertainment, I would jump all over this HP OmniBook X Flip. I may consider stepping up to the 16 inch with more storage than the 512gb that comes with this specific machine, however that is just personal preference and you can't go wrong with any computer in this lineup that you choose!",0.18019097222222227,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I've been looking for a new laptop that I can take when I mentor at a local Robotics group. It needs to have decent processing power, touchscreen, long battery life, non-proprietary charging, and HDMI port. This HP Omnibook X Flip 14 fit the bill quite nicely.

Picking up this laptop, it's got a little bit of weight at nearly 3.5 pounds. On the left side, you have a USB-A port, and HDMI port and two USB-C ports. Having the physical HDMI port built in saves me from having to bring a dongle/adapter with me wherever I go. On the right side, there is an audio jack and another USB-A port. Overall decent amount of ports. 

Processing power is granted by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 which is paired up with Radeon 840M graphics. That gives this machine 6 cores and ability for 12 threads. It has plenty of horsepower to be used as a programming PC. It comes with 16 GB of RAM which is a decent amount of RAM for most uses these days. I would shy away from any lower amount of RAM these days. Unfortunately, the RAM is not upgradeable on this PC. I found the service manual and it doesn't mention any memory replacement options.

The storage is rather minimal for my needs. 512 GB of SSD on an NVMe drive. Fortunately, this storage is replaceable. There is only one M.2 slot so if you are upgrading and want to keep the OS or contents of your drive, you'll have to get an adapter and do some work. I've done this before so I have the adapter, I'm just waiting for the pricing to come back down on a 2TB drive. I've had laptops in the past that had 2 M.2 slots that made upgrading easy. Otherwise a modern external SSD is another great option.

The screen is a 14"" touchscreen with a resolution of 1920 x 1200. What's more is that it has a 360 degree hinge, so you have the flexibility to flip the hinge from a normal laptop format all the way to a tablet style. The hinge is pretty solid and holds at the angle you set. This is important to me because there are sometimes we have to set up our playing field with exact dimensions and having a tablet style format is helpful to be able to zoom in on specifications and pan around the official gameplay documents. The display is nice and bright. It's rated at 400 nits.

Battery life has been fantastic. It's rated for 14 hours of mixed use. So far in my week of testing, it's been sipping at the battery. It has a fast charge feature that gives you 0-50% charge in 30 minutes.

Charging is done via a USB-C which is really important to me. Where I mentor, there are about a dozen laptops to use and there are three formats: barrel connectors, proprietary square (that almost looks like a USB port) and USB-C. The team prefers to use the USB-C computers because we can easily buy 65W adapters without having to stick to a particular manufacturer.

The trackpad is just over 3"" tall and just under 5"" wide. So it's a decent size. The keyboard does not include a numpad. But the keys are somewhat larger than I expected.

These days, all laptops are coming with about 50 NPU TOPS which gives you a decent amount of local AI processing power. This is plenty to run Windows Copilot. HP also has their HP AI Companion (Beta). The HP AI Companion does need you to sign in with an HP account though.

I've been looking at the whole package of this HP Omnibook X Flip 14. The only place I'm disappointed is the non-upgradeable memory. I've been seeing a trend laptops not allowing memory upgrades for a couple years now, so it is not surprising. I think the included 16 GB of RAM is plenty for a vast majority of users. Otherwise, this laptop is going to be a great fit for my use.",0.14456587559266135,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"Having owned an OmniBook previously, I was aware of what to expect.  HP has throughout the years put out highly quality, capable laptops at every price point. This laptop was right inline with that philosophy. 

Powered by a Ryzen Processor, this laptop was able to throw everything I could throw at it for general use (Ex: Streaming a movie while scrolling through websites). Even while doing a little light video processing, this computer was able to expediently complete other tasks at the same time. 

While HP boasts an incredible amount of battery life, it goes without saying their numbers are collected in optimal conditions.  However, even when streaming videos at 100% brightness I can still almost eek out ten hours.  Where are you really going to be that an opportunity to charge your computer wouldn’t be available within that timeline?

The two big capabilities that this laptop boasts are the 2-in-1 folding capabilities and the AI processing.  I’m not a big user of the laptop in tablet mode, but my daughter is.  She likes the tactile feel of the touchscreen (as do I), but wishes that the laptop came with the optional stylus for digital arts design and the like.  As for the AI, I am not a fan.  Probably more so because I don’t trust the technology quite yet.  The ability for it to complete medial tasks and make my work time more efficient is nice, but again, not a fan in general.

Lastly, is the physical screen and keyboard capabilities.  I absolutely LOVE the size and feel of the keys. A backlit keyboard is a must, and this one performs great.  The screen is completely capable for streaming and PowerPoints.  The brightness is wonderful in any indoor locations. However, step outside and the screen washes out quite a bit, even at 100 %. There is a strong amount of glare as well.  If you can get a screen cover that gets rid of the gloss a bit, I would recommend it.  Lastly, the viewing angles for this laptop. I guess that could be good for security purposes.  But if you’re trying to share anything from the screen, it makes it difficult.

This would be a five-star laptop if it weren’t for the limitations of the screen and the lack of an included stylus.  However, even with those modest flaws I would recommend this laptop to friends and family.",0.22837516087516085,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"This is my second OmniBook, I got one for my wife last year and after she had a good experience with it, decided to get one for me. This laptop comes with AMD's Ryzen AI 5 340 processor, with 6 cores, 12 threads, and typical speeds of 2.0 Ghz. The screen is a 2K IPS LED with a brightness rating up to 400 nits. I was impressed that HP included Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with the OmniBook, resulting in a scratch resistant screen. Graphics duties are handled by the Radeon 840M, which is integrated into the 340 series processor. I know when I hear integrated graphics, I kind of lose interest, but the AI 5 340 chip with the Radeon 840 integrated graphics has gotten some good reviews from the different websites out there.

The OmniBook X Flip does have four modes of use: laptop, tent, tablet, and reverse. All four worked seamlessly. The keyboard has large keys with little space in between them, and I found myself more than once fat-fingering adjacent keys. They have a refreshing little click to them, and the travel is very low. I'm not sure how I feel about the keyboard, but at this point, it's just okay. It can be backlit, which is very nice, sometimes laptops in this price range are not. 

Port-wise, it's always good to see an 'old school' USB connection, 2-USB-C connections (one is used for the power supply), HDMI, and a headphone jack. I really appreciate the headphone jack inclusion. Storage is a 512 GB SSD, and RAM is 16 GB, which is great to see on a laptop at this price range.

The speakers get decently loud and sound okay at lower volumes, but you'll want to use headphones for any serious listening. 

So all this together, how does it work? My opinion is the OmniBook X is perfect for the home user who multitasks and uses standard office programs, watches videos, and does some light gaming. During my use, the OmniBook X had some challenges viewing 4K content at high framerates and got bogged down pretty quick while playing anything more than Minecraft or Stardew Valley. But let's face it, the OmniBook X is not touting itself as a gaming computer or a 4K machine. In use, it ran cool, and other than a couple of times when I tried to stream 4K video or play Final Fantasy X, I didn't feel like it hung up, stuttered, or got hot. I have a test where I open dozens of tabs on the internet and access memory-intense webpages and leave them all running in the background while opening Office apps and playing music. The OmniBook X handled this test really well, which means it will work just fine for most home users.

I feel in this price range that HP has a winner. The OmniBook X with AMD's 300 Series AI processor is lightweight and powerful enough for the home office user.",0.25441622574955913,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"HP has put out some great laptops over the years and this one is no exception. 
This laptop doubles as a tablet. You can fold it backwards and it turns to a tablet. This is great for drawing with the stylus or if you just prefer a tablet most of the time but also want a laptop with a solid keyboard. The sensitivity of the touch screen was great out of the box. I didn’t need to do any adjustments in settings. It was easy to switch from programs while in tablet mode as well. 
The overall feel of the laptop is of high quality. It doesn’t feel flimsy at all. The casing is made of aluminum allowing it to be super light at just over 3lbs. Great portability! They keyboard is backlit for easy use in darker places. It has a multitouch track pad which I love compared to one with keys. Battery life is rated for 19.5 hours. I’m on about 6 hours use and 12 hours stand by now. The screen is 14 inches which is perfect size for portability and functionality in my opinion. 
The guts of this laptop are above par. With AI built in, they spared no expense for memory, graphics and storage. The new Ryzen processors  are top notch.",0.45860962566844926,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"The Omnibook X Flip is a pretty impressive ultra portable that gives a plenty of power and battery life.

Set up was no different than any other Windows based laptop. Log in, run a bunch of updates, remove programs you don't need or want. After an hour or so of setting things up (and retrying failed updates - seems to be more common with Windows lately, happens on every computer I use) you can move on to actually using it.

The power, while more than good enough for general use, can be a bit sluggish at times, especially when multitasking with a bunch of tabs in your browers and multiple programs open. More memory would help as would more diskspace so you don't keep checking your free space as you work.

One feature that's not listed on the specs page is that the Flip supports Windows Ink. I figured they included a glass screen for a reason and whooped out my Bamboo Ink Pen and paired it. Sure enough it works and supports pressure sensitivity. Nice surprise on that part. If you do a lot of writing I suggest getting a screen protector. It's easy to get a small grit of sand on the pen and ruin your pristine screen.

For me, 14"" is a perfect size for a portable. 13 is kinda too small and 15-16"" is best suited for laptops you're not gonna use as a tablet. The size gets a bit awkward, and the weight can be a bit for some people. 14"" gives you plenty of real estate, a chasis that can hold a slightly bigger battery, and small enough to handle easily.

This is the perfect laptop for someone who doesn't need Ultra but wants a good laptop for school or work.",0.219212962962963,Positive
HP,HP 14-fk0013dx,"I replaced my computer at work with this one as my job is starting to experiment with AI - not to mention that the computer that they provided me was severely outdated and slow! 

This laptop runs on the 6C / 12T AMD Ryzen 5 340 AI Processor, which puts it somewhere in the i5-class performance range. The built-in graphics is the Radeon 840m. 

By giving up a little horsepower, what you get in return is a laptop that has respectable battery life above and beyond the 2-3 hours that most mainstream laptops give you (regardless of their advertised specs). 

This 14"" model comes with a Gorilla-Glass screen, making it less susceptible to breakage or shattering. It's also wickedly clear - the brightness combined with the resolution on a screen this size makes for a very crisp picture regardless whether you're doing work, email, watching videos, or just viewing photos. 

Memory is 16GB , but I don't believe it's upgradeable , so if things get to a point where more RAM is required you're due for an upgrade. Also, the SSD is ""only"" 512GB - personally I've yet to find a need for larger than 512GB except for on a machine that is being used for gaming. 

Keyboard is backlit (white only) and is rather pleasant to type on. No numeric keypad here though.

HP,HP 15-fa2013dx,"I got this laptop during a Deal of the Day about 2 weeks ago. It was at $599 but I got an open box at $508. First thing I did was buy 32gb of Ram and a 2tb NVME drive. Installing the drive and ram was pretty straight forward. I was surprised that the laptop had 2 NVME slots. 

I was debating between a handheld gaming pc or a  gaming laptop. I do light gaming and also use slicing software for my 3D printer. I have to say, I am not disappointed at all with the Victus laptop.

I have been playing the Gears of War beta and it looks great. I am getting over 100 fps. One thing I noticed when I have the system metrics going is that GoW Beta makes the CPU run at 100%, same with CoD and any graphic intensive game. I think the i5 processor is likely the culprit but the thermals stay in a good range. Don't get me wrong, you can hear the fans when they go on high but I can also hear my wall AC so it's not a big problem. 

I seriously wanted to splurge on the Asus G14 or G16 but did not want to spend all that money, especially since I didn't need all that power. The screen isn't something to brag about but it gets bright enough and I honestly keep my laptop connected to an external 2k monitor so its a none-issue for me. 

The HP Omen software is pretty good in that it lets you tweak your games using their AI to switch the game to the beset display settings but outside of enabling the metrics, I rarely use it 

I think if you can find this laptop at $500 or below, it is a great buy, just get more ram.",0.18798850574712644,Positive
HP,HP 15-fa2013dx,"this is a pretty solid choice if you’re looking for a budget gaming laptop. it can handle a lot of games at high settings when plugged in, and the high refresh rate makes the desktop super smooth. the battery life is also pretty decent esp when you’re just browsing or doing light stuff. a downside, however is the build quality. it’s made out of plastic so its kinda flimsy and the hinge is a bit wobbly as well :/ it also runs hot and loud when u do heavy gaming. the screen is fast and i also like the colors which I think would be great for creative work but thats just me :)) overall its a pretty good pick (taking into account ur budget) if u want strong performance for the price and dont pay much mind to the cons",0.25469696969696975,Positive
HP,HP 15-fa2013dx,"Overall I would say this laptop is ok for the price. I'll admit my attitude going into it wasn't the best because I feel I was forced into purchasing a new laptop just to get Windows 11 before October, but it had to be done and so far this laptop has met my requirements at least. I've had an ASUS gaming laptop for almost 15 years that I've really enjoyed so it's been really difficult for me to have to replace it. I've actually tried a few replacements over the years but ended up returning them for various reasons and just ended up taking the ASUS in for repairs because it was somehow outperforming the newer, more expensive models I was trying to replace it with. I think I still prefer my old ASUS to this HP, but keeping the old one is no longer an option so I've decided this one is sufficient for at least the next few years.

The main issue I have with it so far is the touchpad. Since I've not been in the market for a new laptop for quite some time I had no idea it wouldn't have actual buttons to left and right click. I'm getting used to it, but I don't see myself ever preferring this to tactile buttons. Also no matter how I change the sensitivity settings I'm still having issues with it. Even at the lowest settings I'm still getting a lot of accidental clicks and dragging issues while being unable to control finer movements to click on smaller buttons. I tried adjusting back to medium sensitivity and the finer movements still aren't improved.

The worst issue I've experienced with the touchpad though is if you place it directly on your lap it goes absolutely berserk. I did some research and finally saw a reddit post where some users had narrowed it down to an issue with the plastic casing. Somehow the touchpad will sense anything around it or even under it. Just resting it on your legs can trigger unintended 3 or 4 finger gestures. The 2nd time I used the laptop on my lap I placed it on a cooling pad and it eliminated the issue, but I still would have liked to have known about it before purchasing. The first time it happened I spent a good 4 hours fighting with it, thinking I'd gone insane and was somehow failing to be able to use a simple touchpad before finally finding this information. I had scoured the reviews to a similar model this one was based on (this one only had 1 review at the time I purchased it) and not a single person mentioned this issue. I find that so strange since apparently it's a known issue that many reddit users have complained about.

Personally, I find it very concerning that the laptop casing is so thin and cheap that the touchpad can sense through it. While it does look nice, you can tell right away that it feels kind of flimsy. Thankfully it seems I got a good one at least because during my research I did see photos that others had posted where their touchpad was sunken in along one side and having worse issues. Mine is at least level and functioning but I know for future reference to be extremely careful with it.

I haven't had an HP in a long time but I do like how quickly it starts up. I could do without some of the ads though. For the first week it feels like it gave me weird startup notifications almost every time I started it. Some of them seemed quite urgent like ""low memory"" and ""registry issues detected"", which at first glance is really concerning when using a brand new laptop but I found that if you click to resolve the issue it basically just takes you to an advertisement for HP iolo. I'm fine if a company wants to advertise, but the false system notifications are really uncalled for.

Despite my annoyance and concerns with how well the plastic casing and touchpad will hold up, I have decided to keep it. Keep in mind I've only used it for less than 2 weeks but it does at least perform well. Hopefully it will continue to hold up long-term.",0.04885484885484886,Neutral
HP,HP 15-fa2013dx,"offers good performance for its price, with an Intel Core i5 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 that handle everyday tasks smoothly and run most games well. The 144Hz Full HD screen delivers smooth visuals, though the brightness could be better. Cooling works effectively, but the fans can get loud during heavy use. Battery life is average, lasting a few hours for browsing and less during gaming. The build quality is decent but doesn’t feel premium, especially around the hinge and ports.

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This silver HP15 notebook has a lot of potential (and good bones as I say).  It's based on Intel's i7 1355U CPU, 10 Cores and 12 Threads (2 Performance Cores w/4 Threads, running from 1.7 GHz to 5.0 GHz Turbo and 8 Efficient Cores w/8 Threads running from 1.2 GHz to 3.7 GHz Turbo). Its multi thread rating is 14590 and single thread rating is 3471. Typically consuming 15W but peaking at 55w.  It's a power efficient processor that has been popular in mid to high-end notebooks.  It weighs 3.5 pounds.  With a 1920x1080 HD touch screen. This HP15 does not have a dedicated GPU, instead offering Intel's iRISxe GPU.  IT also does not have a backlit keyboard (which I think a notebook in this price range should have). It also does not have an Ethernet port or a SDcard reader.  It has two USB 3.0 USB-A ports and one 3.0 USB-C port and 1 HDMI 1.4 port (w/HDR). It has a headphone/mic jack.  It supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 (not 5.4). It has a 720P camera with a physical camera shutter (Also I think the camera should be 1080P at this price).  It integrates Microsoft Copilot with a Copilot key. And you can quickly mute the microphone with the F6 key (love this feature).  The USB ports are all limited to 5Gbps, not 10 w/USB 3.1 or 20 w/USB 3.1 v2, it does not support outputting to a USB monitor via the USB-C port.  It has a nice trackpad. The back of the monitor is a silver plastic as is the keyboard base, the bottom of the computer is a lighter weight gray plastic.  The back can easily be removed by removing 4 screws (good/easy).

Intel's iRISxe GPU is a big improvement over older Intel integrated graphics processors, it can handle light gaming at lower settings. It is fine for basic video editing and creative tasks and for browsing the internet.  It's energy efficient; it is not suitable for high-end gaming. It should get about 7 hours of usage on battery power.  It comes with a unremarkable Samsung Gen 4x4 PM9C1 SSD; spec'd to have max seq writes at 4950 MBs and reads at 2500 MBs.  It supports DDR4 memory 3200 MT/s. It comes with 16GB (2x8GB SODIMMs).  The SSD and Memory are removable/replaceable.  This is why I acquired this notebook; to upgrade it.

I did the initial set up and upgrades with the base hardware.  Windows Home 11 requires you to have a Microsoft account to log into. I went through a HP BIOS upgrade and needed at least 3 ""updates"" to get all of the Microsoft updates.

I'm replacing the SSD with a much faster 2TB Orico SSD rated at 7400 seq reads and 7000 seq writes, of which I got 7032 reads and 6348 writes. And I will upgrade the memory to 64GB with G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4 (2x32GB) 3200 MT/s CL22.  To clone the SSD you must disable Windows 11 BitLocker (Encryption), with Windows 11 Home this is slightly more complicated but doable.  The Samsung SSD tested out at 4440 reads and 2105 writes (CrystalDiskMark8).  This is about 30% slower than the Orico SSD.  Both my memory and SSD upgrades went smoothly.

The notebook runs a little warm, you can feel that the left side of the keyboard and palmrest is warmer than the right side. But it has a very nice screen and it's FAST and only 3/4"" thick. The keyboard is just ok, there is a little bit of give, and the island keys have a cheap plastic feel to them, with a so-so key travel (And I've become used to having a backlit keyboard).  With the faster SSD and some configuration changes browsing the internet with either Edge or Chrome (via WiFi 6) was very fast.  I did some audio editing and it was smooth and fast.  The speakers are adequate.  I usually edit with a BT connection or using headphones/earbuds, both of these worked very well.  I do astrophotography where I stack hundreds of night photos.  This is why I needed more memory.  The application I use is not so GPU intensive as it is memory intensive. Loading and comparing hundreds of images can only be done efficiently with lots of memory.  This computer's i7 processor handles this pretty efficiently.  I processed a stack of about 100 images in just over 2 minutes 40 seconds.  My older notebook (2 years old (i7 w/48Gb memory)) took just over 5 minutes.  So this notebook, as upgraded, will be faster; partially because SSDs have gotten faster.  When Gen5 SSD's and notebooks come down in price I'll likely upgrade again.  But for now this is not a bad compromise (once upgraded).",0.12259715380405037,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This is my first HP laptop with a touchscreen. The laptop weighs only about 3.5 lbs thanks to its all plastic chassis; the 45 Watt charger adds another half pound of weight when travelling. The laptop is around 3/4"" thick with a very slight taper from back to front. I like this form factor because it's got a large screen but doesn't feel heavy or bulky. 

This build comes with a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U processor that has a 1.7 GHz base clock with 5GHz max boost, 16GB of 3200 MHz DDR4 RAM pre-installed across two 8GB sticks, and 512GB NVMe Gen 4 m.2 SSD. Note that 16GB is the advertised maximum RAM capacity for this model and it cannot be upgraded further, however, the SSD can be replaced with a larger capacity if desired by removing four small screws on the bottom and popping off the base panel. The power port and a USB-A 3.0 port are at its right-side back corner, and a second USB-A 3.0, as well as HDMI 1.4 out, USB-C 3.0, and combo mic/headphone port are on its left side.

The IPS display is glossy without the matte haze of a glare filter but still rejects reflections well. The max resolution is 1920x1080p FHD with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is decently bright at 300 nits but only has 8-bit color covering 45% of the NTSC color gamut (65% sRGB) which may not be detailed or accurate enough for some creators and digital artists. As I'm more accustomed to 100% sRGB displays, the colors look slightly dull and under saturated to my eye. Clarity is very good though with crisp, easy-to-read onscreen text. The display is powered by Intel's Iris Xe which is an entry-level integrated graphics suitable for casual gaming. Connectivity-wise it supports WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, however, there is no Ethernet port.

At the top of the screen is a 720p integrated webcam with dual-array microphone. The image quality of the camera is serviceable for virtual meetings and live streaming but tends to be slightly grainy with a soft focus even in the best lighting conditions. It has a status LED so you know when it's on and a sliding privacy cover. However, it isn't compatible with Windows Hello facial recognition for login.

The touch features work fine and respond to swipes and multi-finger gestures like pinch-to-zoom. I was also impressed with how oleophobic the glass is, keeping it relatively fingerprint and smudge free. The panel does not, however, fold 360 degrees flat for use as a ""tablet"" and stops around 120 degrees open. The screen's hinge gives slightly when the screen is touched or tapped which makes using it somewhat awkward. Since the large 5""x3"" mouse trackpad is closer to the keyboard, I tend to use it more often out of habit and convenience. 

The keyboard is full-size and includes a number pad on the right-hand side. The up/down directional arrow keys are only half-keys, however, which takes a bit of getting used to and may impact one's gaming experience. While the exterior of the laptop feels pretty solid, there is a bit of flex to the keyboard deck and a sense of hollowness when typing. The keys are also fairly clicky with a high actuation force and rough plastic-y feel which is different from the soft-touch mushiness that I'm used to in laptops. The keyboard's top row consists of action keys by default, like emoji menu, brightness, volume, and playback controls, while F-functions are secondary. There's a dedicated key for launching HP's system control and configuration apps, Omen Gaming Hub and/or myHP, as well as Window's AI assistant, co-pilot.

The power, caps lock, and speaker/mic mute keys all have status LEDs built-in so you know when they are toggled on. One of the things that I found really impressive was the sound quality of the downward-facing stereo speakers. They are loud with a bright, rich sound that resonates throughout the entire keyboard deck with only the slightest hint of tinny boxiness and distortion at max volume. The fans are also surprisingly quiet and don't compete with the speakers making this laptop a good fit for consuming music and streaming video content.

The battery charges quickly, in only a couple hours, and its status LED will turn from orange to white when fully charged. While it’s rated to last up to nearly 8 hours on battery, I found that on max brightness I’m usually able to only get around 2-3 hours of mixed use from it (gaming, web browsing, word processing, and listening to music at medium volume). To extend the battery life to its max, you'll need to enable Eco settings and reduce screen brightness, etc. 

Overall, this laptop is a decent mid-level, general use laptop that is lightweight, quiet, and fast while offering a large screen. While color accuracy isn’t top tier and only the SSD can be upgraded, its specs are good enough to handle games like Warframe and Path of Exile at medium graphics, and it performs well for everyday tasks like web browsing and consuming media.",0.13690954394442764,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"The design of this laptop is functional and suitable for both school and work scenarios. The plastic build contributes to its light weight, although it feels less sturdy. The top cannot be lifted with one hand and tends to wobble during use. The screen features thin bezels but has a thicker chin. It includes a camera with a security slider and microphone holes at the top. 

The laptop is equipped with a few ports: HDMI 2.1, two USB-A, and one USB-C (which does not support Thunderbolt 4, charging, or video output) but offers super-speed capabilities. 

The full-size keyboard may feel slightly cramped, requiring an adjustment period. The keys have good travel and spring, though they may feel less durable. There is no backlight, which may affect typing in low light conditions. The trackpad is highly responsive and smooth, with satisfying springboard-style clicking. 

The 1080p-60Hz display performs adequately in most situations. However, at 300 nits, the brightness is insufficient for well-lit environments, and the glossy screen may be problematic. Color accuracy is limited, making it unsuitable for serious photo or video editing. 

For security, this laptop does not support face or fingerprint Windows Hello.  

Performance is adequate for a mid-range laptop. The i7-1355U processor handles regular productivity tasks, content consumption, and web browsing efficiently, supported by 16GB of RAM allowing multiple apps and tabs to run simultaneously. The laptop struggles with more demanding tasks such as advanced content creation and gaming. While there is no overheating, the fans activate frequently and can be loud. A 512GB SSD is enough space for most users. The AI feature is there for those like me who are getting into it. The 720p camera and microphone work well enough for most video calls, but are not very good.

The speakers provide clear sound without strong bass, and the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone jack is practical for users who prefer wired headsets. 

The battery life extends through a full workday and often longer. The power brick is compact but uses a proprietary plug instead of USB-C. 

Overall, this laptop is a viable option for students or users seeking a budget-friendly device despite some limitations.",0.1711229998072103,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"My business is IT – so I see all kinds of laptops, desktops, all-in-ones everyday day.  Today I received the HP - 15.6"" Full HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Natural Silver, Model:15-fd0127dx and gave it a run.

Setup was a breeze – like most Windows PCs today.  No glitches or issues right out of the box.  

The initial impression is that it’s a clean-looking machine, light with a small 45 watt charger.  Weighs in at less than 4 lbs total including charger.  HOWEVER, the first thing that caught my eye is the old-style round plug charger.  I just can’t figure out why manufacturers don’t just leverage the more modern USB-C charging that many of today’s laptops already have built in.  Can it really save you that much money?  HP – if you’re reading this – we’d love an explanation!  That took 1 Star off the review immediately.

Next, once setup, I began to surf the web a bit and type a few documents.  In fact, I’m typing this review on the very device – and I’m notice a bit of funkiness with the keyboard.  I guess it just doesn’t really feel solid to me as it gives in a little bit when typing.  Also has a very plastic-like feel and click to the keyboard.  May not bother you – but I notice it.

The screen is very nice – although not 4k quality, it will suffice for most business and productivity use cases – as this is NOT a gaming laptop.  It folds out to about 120 degrees, feels solid when using the touchscreen (doesn’t seem to move if you have light fingers) and produces nice colors and clarity.
This model has a large touchpad that works well and feels responsive.  It supports multi-finger gestures, and I feel it is suited to this mid-range laptop style.

On all my machines, I use a Passmark Performance Test tool to compare the main components.  Overall – this machine produces decent CPU test scores and great SSD hard disk scores (see attached screenshots).  It lacks a dedicated GPU (which is why this isn’t a gaming rig) but it will work perfectly well for everyday surfing, streaming and office work.

Lack of more USB-C ports lost this machine another star in my rating – you only have 1.  You have two other USB-A ports available – do don’t plan to plug lots or peripherals into this laptop unless you have a USB-C dock.

Overall – it’s a fine machine for everyday use, just a bit on the lower side for specs and performance.",0.1918703703703704,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"When my HP Model 15-fd0127dx laptop arrived, you could immediately tell that it was the no-frills, workhorse of a computer that I expected.  With no fancy model names and no extravagant packaging, this 15.6 diagonal touch-screened, lightweight 3.52 lbs, thin 0.73"" thick laptop meets the needs of those who are looking for a moderately priced but powerful work / school computer.  

This laptop with its 13th Generation Intel Core i7-1355U high power efficiency 15W low voltage mobile processor with Intel IRIS Xe Graphics at 1300 MHz onboard, 12MB of L3 Cache, 16 GB of DDR4 3200 MHz of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage was designed to hit the latest sweetspot between price and performance and I think this machine does this well.  The 1920 x 1080 dpi 15.6"" IPS LED touchscreen display at 300 NITs brightness provides a clear and pleasant user experience whether viewing spreadsheets, drawing in 3D CAD programs, surfing the Web or playing casual games. 

I am pleased that HP provided plenty of useful ports on this model.  There is a 45W AC pin power port, (2) 3.0 SS USB A ports, (1) 3.0 SS USB C port and (1) 1.4b HDMI port. There is also a headphone and microphone combo port on the right.  

The keyboard has a large, clear font and has a much desired (by workers and students)10-key numerical input. 

There is no Ethernet port.  This HP has WiFi 6.

There is a sufficient 720p front facing video camera that can be placed in privacy mode with the privacy hood.  Paired with the camera are the built-in HD Audio microphone and Stereo speakers, which make for good Zoom meetings or other connected encounters. 

The battery life is rated at up to 7 and 3/4 hours, but I haven't tested this out, since I usually leave my laptops plugged into an outlet.

All-in-all this HP 15-fd0127dx model has everything I need for most work and casual play.  I wouldn't use it for accurate color reproduction for movies or photos, and I wouldn't use it for heavy duty online gaming, but it will do just about anything else that you can throw at it and do it well.",0.1047333333333333,Positive

The build quality feels premium, and the keyboard is very comfortable for long typing sessions. I also appreciate the lightweight design, which makes it super portable.

Overall, this laptop exceeded my expectations. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just need a reliable computer for everyday use, I highly recommend it",0.28677871148459383,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"It's the perfect no-frills laptop. But hey, you can upgrade it if you need to.

Display:
The display on this laptop is Full HD and a great size at 15.6"". The IPS panel only reaches 300 nits, but I find it perfectly adequate. It’s plenty bright for use in a well-lit room. The display is also a touchscreen that is both accurate and responsive.

Battery:
This is where I had to remove a star. The battery life is rated at 7 hours and 45 minutes according to the manual, but after testing, I still haven't been able to hit that estimate. I'm sure I could tweak some power settings, but in 2025, I find it completely unacceptable that a laptop in this price range can’t last more than seven hours during regular use with stock settings out of the box. Again, I could optimize the system to extend battery life, but it would be at the cost of performance.

Overall Specs:
This HP, paired with the i7-1355U and 16GB of RAM, is snappy and perfectly capable of handling everyday browsing, streaming, and any other task the average user could throw at it. I have to give HP massive credit when it comes to upgradeability.

I’m more comfortable than most when it comes to computers, and I’ve been known to upgrade my RAM and solid-state drives when the time comes to beef up a system. I was pleased to see that neither of these components is soldered to the motherboard (see photos). I opened up my system so you don't have to, and I had the biggest grin when I saw that not only is this system running dual-channel RAM (two sticks of 8GB), but the M.2 solid-state drive is also easily accessible. This means that years down the road, when your system isn’t as fast as it was out of the box or you run out of storage, any computer technician or DIYer could upgrade this system in minutes. I love seeing manufacturers giving consumers these options… well done, HP.

Ports:
Unfortunately, I think most people in the market for this HP would want an SD card reader, and this laptop doesn’t have one. This isn’t a dealbreaker for me, but I know some people still want the convenience of sliding in an SD card without needing an additional dongle. Other than that, this laptop has all the ports you'd expect.

I also don’t love that HP is still using a barrel-jack-style charger. Can we please just adopt USB-C as the standard? The USB-C port on this HP is for data transfer only, which is a missed opportunity.

My Wish List:
This laptop would have been exceptional with a few more creature comforts. There’s no backlight for the keyboard, the charger is proprietary, and the battery life is subpar. Had these features been addressed, this laptop would have been a slam dunk. That being said, if you're a student, casual user, or primarily run basic office applications, this laptop will do everything you need.",0.22423611111111114,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"On paper, the HP 15-fd0127dx sounds like a standard, good, middle of the range laptop.  It has a colorful and clear 15.6” LED 1080p touchscreen that’s not the brightest at 300 nits, but still fine indoors in normal lighting.  It has an i7 processor, 16 gigs of DDR4 RAM which is more than enough for normal tasks and a bit beyond.  The 512 gig SSD drive is speedy and has enough storage for many.  It doesn’t even weigh 4 pounds so it’s light enough to carry in a backpack.  The speakers (on the bottom) are so-so ok but do the job. So it has all the basics and a bit more.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of glaring issues that I can’t get over. 

Setup was pretty standard. Your power comes from a 45w small power brick that unfortunately, isn’t USB-C… It’s a proprietary plug. You’ll need to reserve a bit of time, as the HP will have a quite large update out of the box once starting up.  Once up and running, things run smoothly with the processor and RAM working together.  Graphics are from an integrated IRIS Xe chip, but it works well enough.  Basic to mid-range games run fine on it, though heavy-hitter games needing higher frame rates might stutter a bit.  Image editing works fine with common editors and small video projects will run along fine as well. 

You have a few ports, but they’re somewhat outdated by 2025 standards.  You have two older USB-A style ports, but today, most items have migrated into USB-C, and there is only one USB-C port on the left along with one USB-A, a HDMI port, and your headphone jack. The other side has another USB-A port and the proprietary power plug-in.  There isn’t a memory card slot.  A 720p web cam sits on top of the monitor which does ok in very good light – less so in lower light, and lacks in details and color accuracy.  

Microsoft Copilot is installed with Windows 11, so you can ask Copilot a variety of things to get help with writing, rewording documents, finding solutions to answers and much more.  This is a good feature that now is standard on most Windows laptops and is a good edition to this one.  I find myself using it more than I thought I would.  Use responsibly, as they say. 

I do not however, have a good time using the keyboard.  The keyboard on this model feels very flimsy and plasticky. The give of the keys just feels low-quality, as though they are from a much less expensive machine.  While usable, longer typing sessions become uncomfortable.  There is also no back lighting on this keyboard – unimaginable today, and especially on this level/price of laptop.  You do get a full numeric pad on the right, and standard controls via the function keys for the basics, including one dedicated to inserting emojis in applicable programs. Since having a good quality keyboard is one of the most important parts of a computer however, this is the biggest flaw on this model. There is no fingerprint reader. The trackpad is a decent size and feels fine, allowing for all basic gestures and clicks. The overall build quality of the laptop is good, but again, the keyboard quality drags it down considerably.

The battery charges reasonably quick and specs say you get just over 7 hours with varied use.  I found it to be more like 5 ½ hours of mixed use, at least the way I use it.  Not great but not the worst, but you will have to take the propriety charger brick/cable with you if you plan on using this all day out and about. 

Unfortunately, I just can’t recommend the HP 15-fd0127dx.  While the overall specs are fine and it runs ok from an operational standpoint, the plasticky keyboard with no backlighting ruins it for me. Having a propriety power plug in the age where most everything is charging and using USB-C cables is a negative, and not having more than one USB-C port today?  I’m afraid I just can’t give this one my thumbs-up.",0.15014687100893992,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"For those who require a dependable machine for both business and enjoyment, this laptop is a great fit since it balances portability and performance. This is my view of what this laptop provides,The machine has a professional yet contemporary look from its elegant, natural silver finish. For a laptop in this price category, the construction quality seems strong and the casing feels to be minimally flexible. Particularly for individuals who would want touch interactions or occasionally use the device in tablet mode, the touch screen adds a degree of ease. 

Though it's not the brightest panel available, the 15.6-inch Full HD touch screen is vivid and shows good color reproduction. Regarding regular productivity chores, streaming, and casual gaming, the display excels. On professional front the photo or video editing, you may feel the color accuracy and brightness deficient when compared to more upscale versions. Driven by its DDR4 16GB of RAM and 13TH Gen Intel Core i7 processor, this laptop easily manages most of the multitasking. From running several browser tabs to working with video editing tools, the performance is seamless. Quick boot times and speedy application launches guaranteed by the inbuilt 512 SSD storage greatly improve your experience. 

Though it can manage difficult jobs, this is a U-series chip, which means it's intended for efficiency rather than raw power, hence performance-wise it's not on par with H-series chips. The battery life of this device is among the usual points of contention. For those wanting a full day's work without a charger, it falls short even if it's sufficient for moderate use roughly 4–5 hours. Though it's a trade-off for the power it packs, if you travel frequently this is something to take into account. Crucially for productivity, the keyboard offers a good travel and comfortable typing experience. Though it's not a deal-breaker, the touchpad might use a little more responsiveness even if it is functionally sound. 

The laptop has a good range of connectors, including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and charge port which supports charging, screen output, and data transmission and Headphone Jack, nearly non-existent in present market. For connectivity particularly for people who utilize docking stations or must connect several peripherals, this is a major advantage. The laptop can warm under severe use, and the fans may grow somewhat noisy. For most users, this won't be a daily concern, for places where silence is required, this isn't ideal. 

Based on my usage i can confidently say the HP 15-fd0127 presents outstanding value. Though it's not the least expensive choice, it's fairly priced for what you get a strong processor, lots of RAM, and a touch screen. For the typical user, this laptop checks several criteria the trade-offs are in battery life and maybe display quality for creative workers. This laptop is a well-rounded one that performs for its class really brilliantly. For professionals, students, or anybody else depending on a consistent machine for regular computing chores with sporadic heavy lifting, it's perfect. Although it has several drawbacks, especially with regard to battery life and screen quality for professional work, its benefits in performance, build quality, and connectivity make it a good option for anyone trying to strike a mix between cost and competence. Should you be able to live with its concessions, this laptop will be useful for many years.",0.22153782290768592,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This laptop has a very uninspiring name, it is just called hp laptop 15. It is thin and light. The back of the laptop is made of plastic but the build is sturdy and has very little flex. Build quality is very good. All the seams are tight.
For 15-inch laptop, this laptop is not heavy at all. Can easily be used as a travel laptop.

This laptop is also very speedy. Boot up very fast like just 13 seconds.
Every application or game I throw at it run fast and smooth. I am surprised that the integrated graphics by intel called iRIS xe can run games like Need for Speed smoothly. Playing Fortnite though is a bit too much but still playable with correct setting.
Browsing web or working or typing has no problem but the fan is always running when the power is plugged in. Luckily it is not loud. Running on battery is very quiet. 

Laptop this thin will get warm and this laptop does get a bit warm especially during Windows initial update and playing Fortnite but I think it manages quite well.

Typing on the keyboard is comfortable, the keys are well spaced but sounds hollow when pressing down the keys. The only flaw of this laptop is no backlit keyboard! Why? Actually there is another thing I don't like, it requires me to register with email before I can proceed during the initial setup.

The touch pad is very responsive. No complain there.

The screen is bright and easy to my eyes. Color is rich but not too intense. 
The screen Bezel size is acceptable. Touch screen is responsive. 

The stereo speaker is very good, loud and clear.

15-inch laptop is expected to have multiple ports, this laptop has two usb-a and one usb-c. In my opinion one usb-c is not enough.

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"The HP 15-fd0127dx is a VERY solid mid-level budget laptop with specs suitable for all but the most resource-intensive applications such as those dealing with 3D graphics.

This processor for this laptop is a 13th generation i7-1355U, running at 1700 Mhz with 10 cores. This is a small step up from the Intel 12th Generation Core i7 processor in an earlier version of the 15-fd0000 line, the 15-fd0107dx. The Microsoft PassMark rating for the processor is 16710.6, which is respectable at the 58th percentile. The PassMark ratings for the 16 GB memory and 512 GB SSD are very strong, at the 77th and 82 percentiles. Only the 3D graphics rating was below the 50th percentile (31st), and the overall PassMark rating was exactly at the midpoint, 50th percentile. Overall, a very solid computer at a reasonable price.

I weighed the HP 15-fd0127dx with a postage scale and was surprised that this 15.6"" screen laptop was not much heavier (3 lbs., 9.5 oz) than my 13"" screen HP Spectre (3 lbs., 2 oz.). The Spectre has served me extremely well over the past five years, as have previous HP Envy and Spectre laptops I have owned. In my experience, HP laptops are real winners, which is why I did not hesitate to get the 15-fd0127dx.
 
There are a half-dozen features of the 15-fd0127dx I am ambivalent about.

1. The laptop uses a Chicony a18-135p1b charger with a standard plug rather than charging through a USB-C port like my Spectre. This frees up a USB port, but also means I am totally dependent on the provided charger. I cannot, for example, use my Anker PD USB charger in a pinch. 

2. I like the large keyboard with a number pad, but there is no backlighting.
 
3. The three USB ports are adequate, but two are A and only one is C; given that C is the new standard, it should have been two Cs and one A. Also, the C USB port is not a Thunderbolt port.

4. The SAMSUNG MZVL8512HELU-00BH1 512 GB SSD will probably be adequate for most users, but I actually replaced the SSD that came with my Spectre with a 1 TB SSD and have filled that drive to just over 512 GB. I will have to either refrain from copying my photos and videos to the new laptop or (more likely) replace the 512 GB drive with a 1 TB drive.

5. The HP 15-fd0127dx includes an HDMI connector, always useful when traveling for connecting the laptop to a large-screen TV in a hotel or Airbnb, but probably unnecessary in day-to-day work at home because the 15.6"" screen is big and beautiful. 

6. The HP True Vision HD camera is fine for things like video chat, but it is not IR, which means Windows Hello facial recognition is not available for logging in.
 
Some users might question why this laptop is made of plastic and not aluminum like the Spectre line and why the hinge does not allow folding back the screen to use in tablet mode. If you want those features, you should buy a more expensive laptop. Honestly, unless you are extremely careless with the laptop, you will not break the hard plastic construction. And using a laptop this big as a tablet does not make much sense. The HP 15-fd0127dx may lack a few features, but that is understandable, given its low price, and I think that budget-minded users will be very happy with the features it does have and its excellent performance. I certainly am.",0.1404398577612863,Positive

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"So this is a interesting laptop. I would put it in the budget friendly category. Anyone should be happy to use this unless you are one of those picky keyboard people who need it to sound a certain way and click a certain way.

It has decent brightness but don't go into it thinking about HDR content. If you don't have any vision problems you can get away with leaving the initial display settings alone. If not you might want to set the scale to 150%. Performance from the CPU and the integrated graphics is decent. Was able to play a FPS from 2017 on low settings and it was able to run it at 45fps. 

If full sized keyboards are your thing then you will like this one. 15.6 inch display is pretty good and makes this a good all around use laptop. Unless you need to have the fastest of everything then you are definitely in the wrong space looking at this.

The battery life is decent and the wifi-6 and Bluetooth are handy. Shouldn't have any connectivity issues using this laptop. The lack of being able to charge using USB-C was probably a bad move. You are stuck using a traditional charger with the barrel plug. The cooling vents at the bottom are good for those new coolers that pull in air and blow directly on the bottom and creates a seal on the bottom of the unit that helps direct the cool air into the laptop.

If you like a light laptop, you will like this one. Not heavy and very portable. It will fit into any bag.

Would I recommend this to someone? Yes I would. HP has always made a decent product for the average user that as long as you take care of it, it will last a while. A upgrade to a larger drive would probably be in your future unless you are going to use a external drive which I would recommend.",0.21427183927183924,Positive

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This HP 15.6” Touch-Screen Laptop is a solid, mid-tier, laptop for everyday use. Unboxing was quick and out of the box, step one is plugging in the laptop and then you are good to go. The material used to make the laptop is lightweight. This was not expected but for the size of the laptop but it is light at 3.5lbs and very easily moved. The material is smooth and rounded on edges, making a simplistic feel and appearance. This laptop can easily be placed in a backpack or bag to be used on the go, while not over-weighing or fatiguing the carrier. That was probably my biggest complaint about my laptop while in college, was it got heavy! The display is clear and there are no issues viewing work related documents or videos. Having an HD screen has become standard at this point and the laptop does not have an obvious defect in this realm - instead it has the upgrade of being a touch screen device. I have not worked very closely with a touch screen device in the laptop realm before (mainly tablets) and do not think there was any loss of display due to this feature. The touch screen allows for a multi-modal approach at tasking, if while typing, one does not feel like swapping down to the touchpad you can just click on the screen and keep going. My child enjoys being able to click something on the screen and make it happen. The screen is also 15.6 inches, which is a moderate size screen that appears larger than I expected. The keyboard also fit more than I had expected. There is a numeric keypad, which most laptops do not have. When considering this device for work-related activities, this is a game changer if one works with numbers or needs to type them frequently. The keyboard design also has one of my largest complaints (a friend also thought this was odd) - the power button is not in the corner of the keyboard, rather it to the right mid portion of the keyboard where it would have been on the edge of the keyboard if there was not a numeric keypad included. It is like the keyboard was designed, then a keypad added, but overall layout was not considered past that point. This is a minor detail, but caused some confusion in my brain and just does not lay right in my mind. The provided hardware unlocks the potential for a solid everyday/work device. The i7 paired with 16GB RAM provides adequate processing power to be able to run multiple applications at once, switching between documents and tabs without delay or lag. Having a video playing while also working away at a document. I have not attempted to push the device with any advanced editing programs; however, I would not expect them to run at full capabilities. Rather, this device allows for the standard everyday computing without a hiccup. With that, in regards to gaming, simple gaming appears to work (OSRS can run without issue) but the graphics capabilities would be limiting in any significant gaming effort. The 512GB storage is smaller than most devices have lately, but in the setting of work/school focused, this is more than enough to allow for daily tasking and not running out of space. Gaming or photo editing would need more, but once again I would not expect those services from this tier of device/hardware included. The battery life appears to be decent, has not died while unplugged and on the go for an afternoon but I would want to have the charger available if was going to be using all day. Predicting with standard use would last about 5-6 hours based on observation. I believe it is claimed to last about 7 hours, but that would make me nervous to bank on. There is an HDMI display connector, so that if you need to plug in device to display on a TV or projector this is easily completed. Have had no issue with connecting to WiFi using this device. Other worthwhile mentions are that the operating system is Windows 11 and Microsoft Copilot available, this appears to have become standard for most devices at this point.",0.12960918710918712,Positive

Perfect for work, students and anyone else that wants to be connected to the Internet while still having the processing power to do almost anything else, like surfing the web, checking emails, picture and video editing. Spread sheets and using AI programs etc.

The specs on this laptop are the minimum anybody should be buying these days, there are cheaper laptops out there for sure, but they have lower specs as well. What you get here is not only quality, but you will be future proofing your investment. 

Some features include:

Screen: 15.6 touch-screen FHD
1080p definition, very crisp very clear, and at 15.6 inches it is a pretty large size screen for a laptop.

Processor: Intel i7
A very capable and somewhat high-end processor. Probably the most expensive and best component of this laptop. Very future proof and very capable.


RAM: 16 GB SSD
More than enough to run pretty much any application, program, or software. Enough RAM to future proof, your investment for a long time. And of course, all this comes in a solid state drive. Or SSD. They run faster, quieter, and more efficient than the old Hard Drives.

Memory: 512 GB
Not the most memory available, but still decent. You’ll be able to store a few high definition, movies programs and music, but that’s about it, you will most likely run out of memory if you do a lot of downloading. The thing is that you can buy additional memory pretty cheaply these days. 

Graphics: Intel Iris Xe
A very entry-level graphics card. Will only be able to play very simple games, well like I mentioned earlier, this is not a gaming laptop. This graphics card should be good enough to run anything else that’s not considered a video game. For example, little handle basic video editing. Programs and software. 

Conclusion:
A very fast, a very capable laptop, has all the connections you need like USB-A, USB-C, HDMI etc. It features Microsoft Copilot, which is an AI program to help you create projects, gives you advice, and overall makes things simpler. Comes with a HD Camera and Microphone, long lasting battery, HP claims it can go for 7hrs and 45 minutes. And Stereo Speakers :)",0.20105158730158726,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This laptop gets the job done but not in any style.  16gb of ram, an i7, and 512GB hard drive means that most people that aren’t heavy gamers or 3d modelers will have a smooth experience.  Integrated graphics means that games like Fortnite and other light games will run on here just fine, but if you want any more intensive games this isn’t the one for you.  Now for someone like my kid that thinks Fortnite is the best game in the world; it has a full keyboard including a number pad, and good enough specs that I don’t have to worry about any school application he might need.  This could be perfect for a student like that… besides the inability to write on the screen.  It is a touch screen but doesn’t support pen input and it doesn’t fold all the way over, it is very much a laptop.  So, if you are one to take notes on your laptop that involve handwriting this isn’t the laptop for you either.  But if you type your notes this would be absolutely fine.
The build quality leaves a bit to be desired.  The description is that it comes from recycled plastic, and it feels plastic.  It is decently light for it’s size which is nice, but it doesn’t feel solid, the outside easily compresses to the touch, much more than I would prefer.  The keyboard feels mushy compared to other keyboards I’ve used.  It does work and it’s not the worst, but it is far from the best.  
The ports selection is okay, it has HDMI, 2 USB As, and a single USB C.  I wish it had a USB C on both sides like the USB A and I wish the USB C was capable of charging the laptop.  It uses a proprietary charger, which can be nice, but I really like it when it can charge via the USB C ports as well, as USB C is much more universal.  This one you must make sure you never forget your laptop charger. 
The screen is 1080p and decently bright, not amazing or anything to write home about but it gets the job done. 
Overall, I wouldn’t be afraid of this laptop if it fits the requirements you need spec wise, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to point anyone towards this laptop. It will get the job done.

Pros:
Specs are good (i7, 16GB ram, 512GB Hard drive)
Smooth user experience
Large screen 
Touch screen
Full keyboard with number pad
Cons:
Keyboard is mushy for typing
No USB C charging
No pen support
Outside shell isn’t as stiff as I’d prefer it to be.",0.23743271221532086,Positive

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"There is certainly a lot to like about this HP laptop, but it is clearly a budget laptop that has some compromises.  

First the good.  As stated in the description, this laptop is best suited for productivity applications and for that environment it excels.  The Intel i7 processor, while not overly powerful, gets the job done quickly and efficiently at 5ghz speed, and the 16GB RAM means that apps and programs load quickly and can have multiple apps open at once.  That's also good for some very basic gaming, although the graphics processor is pretty basic.

The 1920x1080 screen is good, but not great.  Detail is crisp, but the screen brightness, at only 300 nits, isn't great for very bright rooms or outside.  

512GB storage capacity is the bare minimum these days.

I do appreciate the fact that this laptop was made from recovered plastic that was recycled.  This is also the reason for the gold rating of the EPEAT tool, which measure the environmental impact of the product.  

The keyboard is ok.  It feels a bit ""clickety clackity.""  

Now for the bad, and for me these are deal breakers.  HP really needs to get with the program and stop shipping laptops with a proprietary power supply tip and start using USB-C power supplies.  Who wants to lug around a bulky charger when a simple USB-C charger (with enough watts) will do the job?  The laptop does have one USB-C port, but it is not for charging, only for data.

Second, battery life is pretty bad.  With the screen at full brightness and streaming a 1080p youtube video, the laptop lasted approximately 4.5 hours before reaching 3% battery and shutting down.  Of course that could be increased somewhat by lowering the screen brightness, but since the maximum brightness isn't all that bright it needs to stay at maximum.",0.1870943562610229,Positive

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"The HP 15-fd0127dx is an excellent laptop for your basic PC needs. The price is great for what you get. The device itself is very solid yet light and well made. I love the look, feel and finish. It also has all the ports most people need. 1 HDMI, 1 USB C 3.0, and 2 USB A 3.0, and 3.5 headphone, and mic input. 

 The screen is an FHD full touch 15.6” IPS display with very nice graphics. Although not OLED it still looks great. The i7 processor is plenty fast, and combined with the 16gb of ram and 512gb SSD everything boots up very quick and runs with no lag at all. Able to open and run multiple tabs with no issues. 

 It also has Microsoft Co-pilot AI as an assistant. Im still getting use to everything AI has to offer and so far I am very impressed. Looking forward to learning more and more of what it can do. 

 Another nice feature it has is fast charging. It claims it can charge from 0-50% in 45 minutes, but I havent had to test that yet because the battery life lasts a solid day of moderate use. 

 I do plan on upgrading the SSD to 1TB eventually. But for now the 512gb is enough. I am very happy with this laptop. It does all the basic stuff I need from a PC and does it well. If you are looking for a mid tier laptop this is a great choice.",0.39154761904761903,Positive

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"I have a small woodworking shop that I have a CNC and the laptop that I had for use in that finally gave up the ghost, it was about 7 years old and I really needed to update it because it was lacking in speed and memory.  The only reason I didn’t is because the CNC creates so much dust and I hated the thought of putting a new laptop in that environment.  

So I had the chance to receive this HP 15” Full HD touch screen and it is a HUGE improvement. The first thing that I did was my son and I built a “compartment” that houses the laptop and shields it from the dust.  I must say that the best feature that I love about this upgrade is the fact that HP is a great company, I have had several HP computers in the past and I am well pleased w/ them as a company.  But having the use of the touchscreen sure makes it easier when programming/inputing files to the CNC, and especially when it comes time to change the bits.  It used to take a while on my old laptop, now I am done in minutes.  I love the size and the weight of this HP laptop, and the graphics are phenomenal for what I need.  

The initial setup was simple, I made sure it was fully charged and after an update I was able to connect to our home wi-fi w/ out any issues.  The software that I use to run the CNC took a little longer, but I think that was my fault, as my CNC machine is about 50 yds away from my home and I would have been better suited to install everything prior to putting this into the case we made for it.  I have used it for 3 jobs, and they all went smoothly.  I like this HP product and would recommend it.",0.2116287878787879,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"If you are familiar with HP products, the design and styling of this will feel right at home. It has a sleek professional design, fitting in well in any office setting. I also very much prefer the curved edges, I have another laptop that has 90° edges, and from a tactile perspective I am just not a fan. I feel the rounded edges are more elegant and professional. The shell is also nice because it's not as much of a fingerprint magnet as some of my other devices.

 It has two full size USB ports, which is so nice to have, as well as an HDMI port, a USBC Port, and a headphone jack. The webcam provides an excellent image, and can also be closed when not in use, which is great to have built in. 

As for performance, there are two elements to this. As far as being a good workhorse, this computer is great. Plenty of ram, and an i7 processor. By today's standards, the hard drive is getting to be a bit small, but it is half of a terabyte. Unless you are doing super high-end video editing or rendering, this can handle just about anything you throw at it. 

The flip side of performance on this, though, is that it's not a very portable machine in that I'm only getting 3 to 4 hours out of it with high usage. I am often on the go, and I need a system that can go all day with me, and this, unfortunately, is not that laptop. Laptop. However, again, it's great if it's mostly going to be plugged in.",0.3027832512315271,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This HP laptop offers a good overall experience but nothing that really stands out. The one thing about this laptop which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it, is  what it’s made of. The body of it is made of plastic, specifically what HP says is ocean bound and post consumer plastic. I’m all for making things of recycled plastic and am definitely all for cleaning up the ocean, it’s just the plastic doesn’t feel all that durable . I guess I’m just so use to aluminum laptops, I just wish the plastic was a little more dense to add a more rigid feeling like aluminum. 

Spec wise the laptop will definitely make most people happy especially if you’re using this as a consumption device or as a work computer. The core i7 processor along with 16gb of ram handled all of my needs. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 gives you a fast and reliable connection, that allows you to move around without having to worry about losing connection so easily to your router and devices. You get a front facing camera with a physical privacy filter which is nice. The biggest hardware drawback is that it has no backlit keyboard, this to me is a head scratcher at this price. With this HP you get a laptop that is more environmentally friendly with good specs but with some hardware compromises.",0.3009469696969697,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This HP laptop has an overall nice user value to its quality and appearance. This has a spacious sized SSD while having a nice amount of RAM to support the WinOS and multiple application use. Setup is a breeze from out of the box to getting up and running with initial setup of the machine and signing into your Microsoft account. Like any new machine, there are initial updates that must be done to bring the machine fully current from OS updates, HP, and MS Office as a preinstalled application set on the system. The system is very responsive and show no signs of lag under heavy use and connects easily to an external display as an add-on or primary. The laptop overall stays fairly cool and does warm up a bit under heavy use. This is expected with how light and thin the machine is. Overall, the machine would be a good investment for those looking for something to use every day for school, design, business use, and normal use. You can accomplish some light gaming on this system also, for those that like to game.",0.13484848484848483,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"I have a gaming PC that I like, but it's a bit bulky for everyday office needs. I was looking for something that gives me a 15"" class screen and an i7 processor with 16 GB of RAM and has a decent battery life. I stumbled upon the this HP with the right specs and so far it meets my productivity requirements.

The processor is an i7-1355U. That's a 13th generation processor with 2 Performance Cores and 8 Efficiency cores. The 2 Performance Cores give double threads and the Efficiency Cores are single threaded, so you get 12 total threads of processing.

The memory is 16 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM. This is where I was slightly disappointed. DDR4 isn't the newest or fastest. I was also looking this up and it doesn't seem like it's upgradeable. 16 GB is the max for this system.

The storage is mediocre, 512 GB on an NVMe drive. Having done a quick speed test, it reads in the 3600 MB/sec range. I will likely replace this down the road to a more modern 2 TB version when prices come back down. Or I will have to carry a portable SSD.

Battery life has impressed me. It's rated for just shy of 8 hours. So far in my testing, this is pretty accurate. My gaming PC would last me about 2 hours, it's rather bulky and the power supply is bulky as well. This HP is a breath of fresh air. I can easily carry it around and not have to concern myself with a battery for most of my day. I was also surprised at the charging brick. It's tiny compared to my gaming laptop's charger. This charger is rated for 45 watts while most of the other laptops I've dealt with have had minimum 60 watts. 

Ports on the HP laptop on the left side include a USB-A, HDMI, an audio jack and a USB-C. Disappointingly, while the USB-C is rated for superspeed, it isn't rated for power nor display out. For that you would need Thunderbolt and this laptop doesn't support it. I would like to get away from proprietary chargers and have a  more generic USB-C charger like some of my other laptops, but this laptop doesn't support it. On the other side of this HP laptop is a USB-A and the barrel connector for power.

The display is a 15.6"" multi-touch display. It's a glossy screen with nice colors. Resolution is 1920x1080. It's sharp for FullHD. The brightness seems to be in the 300 nits range. It's powered by Intel Iris Xe onboard graphics. This is entry level graphics, which is fine for productivity, but you really can't expect AAA gaming with ultra settings. 

The trackpad is super smooth and is roughly 3""x5"" so it's a decent size. They keyboard includes a numpad which I find important when doing productivity work. Although the keys are a little small. One thing I immediately found is that the texture of the keyboard keys are a little more coarse than I'm used to. It hasn't affected my typing ability, it's just something that felt a little off the first time I used it.

The price is right where I expect an i7 PC to be at. For the price, this laptop might hint at cheaper materials, but under the hood, the specs are giving me confidence that I can throw my productivity apps at it with no problems, and even run a Virtual Machine.",0.09569978632478635,Neutral
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"HP has been making personal computers since nearly the dawn of the PC age (if you include the predecessor companies) and it REALLY shows when they create a quality, balanced laptop like this one is.

When I say this laptop is nicely balanced, I mean that it's rather good at all things.  It's not super overpowered, so it's not a high-end workstation or gaming PC (but nor is it priced like one), it's just a great laptop to use for just about any normal task.  And it's well-built; while it is mostly plastic, it does still FEEL premium and is very lightweight for the size of screen / power of the internals.

So what do you get here?  You get a higher-end Intel mobile chip in the Core i7 1355U which is powerful when you need it (with 10 cores overall, 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores for a total of 12 threads, it's a great multi-tasker) but sips power when you're not asking for much so you still get solid battery life.  The 16GB of DDR4 and 512GB fast NVMe SSD are strong for today should be good into the future as well.  The screen is 15.6"" and FullHD so you have lots of room to work without squinting at tiny text and it does get nice and bright.  It's also very clear for movie watching though the black levels aren't as good as some of the newer screen technologies.  You get a GREAT keyboard with a full number pad and a large trackpad that does seem to support gestures.  Port selection is good though not great with 2xUSB-A, 1xUSB-C and HDMI.  And the laptop is very quiet / near silent even under load which is really nice.

The included Windows 11 install is pretty standard with just a couple of HP helper apps that don't intrude much and a trial of McAfee that is common on many OEMs these days.  The computer FEELS snappy and is great to use plugged in or unplugged for most tasks.  It zips through office tasks, web browsing, media playback (local or streamed), photo editing and more.  The integrated graphics aren't the best but you can play light / retro games just fine particularly with lower resolutions / lower detail levels.

So given what you get - a quality laptop that zips through most everything you might want to do (except high end gaming) at a good price - I can highly recommend this HP effort.  Give it a try today!",0.29670035938903855,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"i7 with a respectable 16 gb of RAM, which is important given the Iris Xe integrated graphics. Xe is much better than previous integrated graphics, but all integrated graphics processors borrow memory (hence the ""integrated"") unlike a dedicated GPU, so your RAM is your big limiting step. 

Ports: USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and power jack
This is my one and major gripe about this HP laptop. For a laptop with these specs on paper, 15.6"" screen, i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD - this is a slam dunk for a solid productivity laptop, especially with the full size HDMI port. But then, they made the USB-C data transfer only, meaning you can't charge the laptop via the USB-C. In 2025, this makes no sense to me, as every device manufacturer has been consolidating their ports. 

Touchscreen matters to some, not to me at all. The OCD in me cringes every time I think about tapping on my screen, and I would personally be wiping off the screen repetitively. But for creative types, or even for simple touch features akin to phones (zoom in/out), touchscreen is a nice quality of life upgrade from using the touchpad. 

Battery life is mid, lasting me only about 5 hours using light video play and mostly Word and Excel use unplugged. I get the form factor is slim, limiting the battery capacity, but again, no dedicated GPU so it was a bit disappointing to me.

Overall thoughts: very solid specs for a productivity use laptop, and pleasant surprise that the Iris Xe graphics can handle most of my Steam library. Not being able to use my USB-C cable to charge this laptop and limit the amount of extra stuff I need to carry in my bag was disappointing but not a dealbreaker for me.

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,I love it. Its the best computer i had in a long while. Its so fast and can keep up with everything and very well with multitasking which is a must. I was nervous about my game that i play but it handles that no problem.,0.2416666666666666,Positive
HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"This system does well for my daughter's schoolwork and general usage. Past that, I'm not sure where I would place it in recommendations. While it does have some decent specifications, it falls short in other areas for a system at this price point. 

The screen is indeed great looking with very responsive touch sensitivity with little to no lag. Videos pop in color and the framerates are smooth if using for cloud gaming. 

Speakers are good enough if at home with minimal noise, but past that, mid-level sound with average performance at best. I will note that voices do ring fairly clear. Those frequencies get a nod. 

Battery life is slightly below average. On a full charge, with basic, non-demanding usage, I'm getting 3-4.5 hours before needing to charge, and that is on the balanced setting. With anything labor intensive, I'd be pushing 3. While the screen is beautiful, I see no other reason to have such limited power.

Regardless of battery, the performance lives up to the i7. Thus far, I haven't had any slowdowns or crashes and the tasks I have applied have been uninterrupted. Alos the heat dissipation hasn't been an issue. While using in my lap, the comfort level hasn't been an issue.

No backlit keys. Minor, but a sore spot for my taste on any machine above $500.

Camera is no frills. Top resolution for video is 720P, and still photos is under 1MP. Works for basic calls, but don't look to do any optimized streaming.

The build of the machine is a mixed bag. The keys have a great tactile sound and feel. Very springy with a satisfying click on each tap, yet the machine itself feels as though one slip, and it's falling apart. The shelled plastic does not feel very sturdy, and I would caution using this as a ""run-and-gun"" laptop as I wouldn't trust the durability.

This leads me to my ultimate issue, and where I would have trouble recommending to anyone with my stature. When using the laptop in my lap, there arises an issue where if I rest my wrist on the ""wrist rest"" area, the pressure causes the bottom of the laptop to compress, and the trackpad will stop clicking. At first, I just thought the machine only supported gestures tapping, but once my daughter and wife used, the ma chine, I realized it was directly correlated to my wrist pressure. It is sporadic depending on wrist angle, but very frustrating when trying to navigate swiftly, thus limiting the full useability of the machine. For that, I dropped a star and would only recommend on a specific basis.

In summary, it is a basic machine that I would only recommend to very casual users who happen to exert light pressure on the wrist rest. Very specific, but that's what it is.",0.11074175824175825,Positive

The sound quality is decent, and enjoying movies or videos on this laptop is a good experience. The build quality is overall ok, but lacking at the price point in my opinion. When typing on the keyboard there is a large amount of flex, and the keys have a very interesting tactile feel but are somehow still very slippery. When typing there is a large amount of flex on the casing which hampers the typing experience, and when using the touchpad it is much worse and actually makes using the touchpad a pretty bad user experience. The battery life is great, especially for such a light laptop. I was able to watch several movies on a single charge, so this would be very sufficient for a cross country flight.

HP,HP 15-fd0127dx,"I'm not an expert with laptops, so take it for what it is worth.
The body of the laptop seems a bit flimsy.  I don't have much to compare it to, but you can twist the whole thing and it flexes pretty easily with little pressure.  I don't think it effects performance, but might not be that durable if you live a rough and tumble life.
I'd don't much like the action of the keyboard either.  It has a real light and cheap feel to it.  Maybe it is just personal preference, but I prefer a bit heavier and thicker feel to the keyboard action, if you know what I mean.
The computing power seems adequate for what I do, which is not much, basic writing and some excel book keeping.  I've watched a few movies on it, and the screen resolution is good.  Internet seems a bit slow, but it is hard for me to determine if that is from the laptop or my internet service.

HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"The OmniBook X Flip is a great all-around 2-in-1 laptop. With its powerful Intel Ultra Core 7 processor and an Intel Arc 140V integrated GPU, this laptop can do it all. From simple tasks like word processing, web browsing, watching films, to some more task-heavy tasks like some light gaming. This laptop is a versatile piece of tech that is great for a student or a business professional who requires that extra processing power or tablet capabilities. This is my review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1 laptop. Read on to learn about some Pros and Cons of the OmniBook X!

*TLDR at the bottom

=========
IN THE BOX/SET-UP:
So, what’s in the box? A laptop that is neatly wrapped in a soft cover, a 65W USB-C charger with a nice, braided cable, and some documentation.

Setup is straightforward. It is your typical Windows 11 out-of-the-box experience. I typically go through the laptop and delete any bloatware or apps I won’t ever use before setting up my stuff. There were some bloatware applications like McAfee and some intrusive HP apps, but overall, I do appreciate that the laptop did not have a lot of bloatware preinstalled.

=========
DESIGN/SPECS:
The OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1 laptop sports a nice matte black color (HP calls it Eclipse Gray, but the color appears black). I love the matte black color, and while the cover is a fingerprint magnet, I’ve noticed that the keyboard doesn’t leave much of an oily finger residue compared to some other laptops I have used. The keys on the keyboard are significantly larger compared to some other keys I have used in the past. It did take a little bit of getting used to the size and travel distance of these keys. There is also no number pad. I prefer a number pad, but it is not a deal breaker for me. Like the keyboard, the trackpad is very large. The large trackpad was somewhat cumbersome when I was typing, and suddenly, my wrist accidentally clicked down on the trackpad or moved the mouse pointer. Something I like about this laptop is the number of available ports for your different peripherals. The laptop has 2 USB-A 3.1, 1 USB-C 3.1, 1 Thunderbolt 4, 1 AUX, and 1 HDMI. Finally, a major selling point is the touchscreen display.  The touchscreen can be used in many ways. It is responsive, but there are certain areas where your clicking will need to be more precise (e.g., closing a Chrome tab because sometimes the touch does not register). There is no stylus, but at this price point, I strongly think one should have been included. 

The OmniBook X contains some powerful internals. An Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, a decent internal GPU (Intel Arc 140V), 16GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD.

=========
PERFORMANCE:
I was able to use the OmniBook X in a variety of situations over the past couple of days. I work in IT and was able to stress test its business capabilities there. I also played some video games and watched a couple of movies/live events in tablet mode. Finally, I ran several benchmark software programs. I will first cover the benchmark software. The first one I ran was 3D Mark. This was used to test out the laptop’s gaming capabilities. While this is not marketed as a gaming computer, the OmniBook X is capable of light gaming. PC Mark was used to test out the computer’s capabilities with modern office applications like Word, video conferencing software, web browsing, data processing, etc., and Cinebench was used to test out the computer’s CPU rendering. The scores for these benchmark applications can be seen below. 

3D Mark
Steel Nomad Light Score: 3114

PC Mark
Overall Score: 4604
*Individual scores for a specific application in the PC Mark image

Cinebench
CPU (Multi Core): 8813
CPU (Single Core): 1860

The benchmarks say this is an excellent office computer that can handle many process-heavy tasks, such as video processing or running virtual machines. A student who uses Premiere Pro or AutoCAD will find that this laptop is great at handling these process-heavy applications. On the other hand, the OmniBook X’s gaming capabilities aren’t ideal, but can be used for light gaming. I played a variety of games, from FPS games like Black Ops 6 to some newer games like Expedition 33. I was also able to play some lighter games like Stumble Guys, which the laptop handled extremely well. The display has a max refresh rate of 60Hz, which is okay for casual gaming. In Stumble Guys, I was able to max out the refresh rate. On B06, I got an average of 58 FPS on basic settings. Not ideal for competitive gameplay, but for casuals, it should be okay. On Expedition 33, the OmniBook X did struggle significantly. I had to set all graphic settings to low, and even on low, I was averaging 33 FPS. Overall, the OmniBook X handles office tasks exceptionally and can handle some video games okay.
 
=========
FEATURES/OTHER NOTES:
The following lists some features and other notes I have about the OmniBook X.

- Built-in speakers are surprisingly good, but the lows are lacking 
- The minimal amount of Bezels makes the display appear larger
- Built-in camera is good, the Poly Camera Pro app helps enhance your video calls and allows video effects
- The 400 nits screen brightness is bright and vibrant
- Great cooling system, the fans are extremely quiet
- An Intel Wi-Fi 6E card is installed in the computer
- 3 free months of PC Game Pass are included with the device. 

=========
CONCLUSION/TLDR:
Overall, the OmniBook X is an excellent office laptop and an okay laptop for gaming. If you are a student or business professional who uses creative apps like Premiere Pro or technical apps like VirtualBox or AutoCAD, this laptop will suit you well. The OmniBook X handles office applications like a champ. On top of handling office apps, the 2-in-1 ability makes this laptop a versatile note-taking tool or a tablet to watch videos. While the laptop can handle games, don’t expect a top-of-the-line performance. More graphically intensive games, such as Expedition 33, I was only able to get about 35 FPS on low settings, which is not ideal. But other games like BO6, I was able to almost max out the 60Hz refresh rate. Regardless, I would still consider the OmniBook X a great all-around laptop that I wholeheartedly recommend you check out!",0.20349992849992854,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"Wow, this thing is a workhorse! I was replacing older 16in HP Omnibook that is great, but I wanted more of the new AI and Copilot features that the newer models have. Let me start by saying how well this Flip Laptop is built. Distinctly solid and aluminum feel, unlike some of the other models out there, you pick this up and you can see and feel how well built it is. Now, that said, it is not light, it is over 4lbs, but if you’re buying a 16in laptop, you’re going to be in this weight range.

The display is a beautiful 2K 1920 x 1200. HDR for video streaming is supported while using HDR. Let’s be clear, if you are using anything less than 16 inches today, you are going to be blown away by the screen real estate on this machine! The fact that it’s a very accurate touch screen, and a flip as well, are just bonus features that make this laptop amazing. While this box may be a bit heavy for the frequent traveler, if you are traveling and going to be in one place for a week or so, it is amazing that you can use this to play YouTube, watch movies, watch YouTube TV, you flip this thing around, or use it in tent mode and wow, you have an absolutely beautiful screen that is significantly better than any smaller laptops. The touch is very responsive for me. There is also a built-in camera cover which I love this feature because then I don’t have to get one of those sticker based camera covers. The camera is 5megapixel front facing. It’s the little attention to details like this in the Omnibook series that are really appreciated. 

Interestingly, the keyboard and keys “feel” large and easy to use but when you set this down and look at it holistically, the keyboard doesn’t seem to take up much real estate. Track pad is large and easy to use and speakers take up more than an inch on each side of the keyboard. You just have to remember that it’s this way to accommodate the screen size, which is fine. The only thing missing from this awesome machine is a fingerprint reader. I have really gotten to like that feature and it’s about the only thing missing!

As for power and performance, this Omnibook doesn’t disappoint. It has 16GB of RAM, 8GB of onboard video RAM from the Intel Arc 140V graphics. Performance is smooth and quick with multiple Word, Excel and PowerPoint files up simultaneously. Although this is not an official gaming laptop, its specs support moderate gaming usage. Another thing I noticed is the superior cooling that this laptop has. I never was bothered by any fan noise and could easily keep the machine on my lap for several hours without even noticing any heat. With 1TB SSD, you won’t run out of space on this box and it’s ideal for locally stored video streaming.

This is a Copilot+ PC, it’s not my first one but I will say, if you haven’t used Copilot+ (Microsoft’s AI), then you are missing out. With the powerful 47 NPU, leveraging all that Copilot has to offer is fast and easy. There is no reason to use most other search engines. Asking Copilot anything you would normally search for, and research is a whole new experience. The depth of information and available is truly mind-boggling. Copilot remembers searches so you can go back later and dig back in. I strongly recommend that you look on YouTube for “prompting” learning and guidance. Learning how to “ask” or prompt Copilot is key to getting not only more of what you are looking for but also a depth of information to improve your experience. You can really improve all your Microsoft 365 applications by leveraging Copilot+ within them. 

This Omnibook also supports up to Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.3. I was also impressed with the onboard Poly Studio and dual speakers. Sound quality was superior to other laptops I have used and tested. As for ports, it has 1-Thunderbolt 4 USB-C, 1-USB-C, 2-USB Type A, 1-HDMI and 1-headphone/microphone port. 

Battery life is slated at up to 23 hours of video playback time. I never ran anything that long but I will say that the battery life that I have experienced is several days of multi-hour use to where I finally hit around 15% so I plugged it in. Compared to my wife’s laptop and a couple of others I use, this HP Omnibook excels at battery life. 

I would recommend this to others; I am giving it 5 stars because it is such a solid performer. If I had any cons at all, it would be the weight at 4.3lbs. It is heavy but it sure is a beautiful and powerful performer!!",0.24956216641457604,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"The HP OmniBook X (Intel Core 7 Ultra, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) is a large 2-in-1 with a really nice IPS display that will satisfy many users.

One thing I've learned over the years of owning laptops and servicing them is that everyone likes different combinations of features.  What I like, you might not like, and vice versa.  So the key when shopping for a laptop is to learn what you like and then finding one that has those features.

I've always been a big fan of 2-in-1 laptops.  One of the main reasons is for travel.  On an airplane, you don't have to power them down like a laptop during takeoff and landing if it is folded flat, like a tablet.  So you can continue to be productive for those extra 40 or so minutes, which can be handy.  And as long as the touchscreen functions well (which this one does), the experience can be very good.

Most of the 2-in-1 laptops I have owned have been on the smaller side--13.3"" or 14"".  I do find the 16"" to be a bit big for a 2-in-1, and a little heavier than I would like.  The weight of the laptop alone is 4 lbs, 9 oz.  It still fits nicely in my backpack, but without a resting surface, it can get heavy for the hands and arms over time.  However, I do appreciate that the power supply is not an enormous brick like so many other larger laptops.  That makes the overall package easier and lighter to carry.  The total weight, including the power supply, is 5 lbs, 3 oz.

The screen is IPS technology at 400 nits of brightness.  I found the display to be plenty bright with rather deep blacks and bright whites.  The screen is not quite OLED level, like on more expensive laptops, but it is very nice--and as I mentioned before, the touch function is responsive and works very well.

The keyboard is a zero-lattice keyboard, meaning there is no space between the keys.  This is the latest styling cue of some more expensive laptops.  This HP integrates the speakers on both sides of the keyboard to fill in the extra space.  Personally, I think the keys are a bit too big and they also have a lot of travel.  I would have rather had smaller keys and a dedicated number pad.  This is a personal preference.

Regarding the speakers, the sound quality was OK.  I did not feel there was enough bass, and the clarity was average.  Volume range was good.  I would have preferred more premium speakers, with the speakers mounted on the underside of the laptop--again, so I could have a dedicated number pad.

For speed and usability, the OmniBook X has the Intel Core 7 Ultra, which is a step above the Core CPUs (formerly the i7, for example).  Intel ARC graphics are a step above the typical Intel Iris graphics.  I ran GeekBench on the system and was a bit underwhelmed with the results.  One of my other laptops has an Intel Core 5 Ultra with 8GB of RAM and the Intel Iris graphics.  The HP having the Intel Core 7 Ultra with 16GB of RAM and the ARC graphics, I expected the GeekBench numbers to be a bit better.  The HP clocked in at 2369 for single core and 10443 for multi-core, with graphics at 27130 with OpenCL.  The other laptop with the Core 5 Ultra was about the same at 2244 / 10480 / 25424.  Further investigation found out exactly why.  The Core Ultra 7 in the HP is running at 2.2GHz with 8 cores and 8 logical processors.  The other laptop with the Core Ultra 5 is running at 3.6GHz with 14 cores and 18 logical processors.  More cores / logical processors means more applications can run simultaneously without bogging down the laptop.  That includes multiple browser tabs.

However, the HP in general functioned well with good scrolling on the internet, no lag with multiple browser tabs open, and good performance with multiple applications running simultaneously.  So for the everyday user that is not overloading the laptop with heavy tasks, it will perform just fine.  I just would have expected more of a jump in the GeekBench numbers, that's all.  The ARC graphics would come into play more with AV-intensive work, like photo or video editing.

However, the Core Ultra 7 is a bit more power efficient, and it shows with the battery life.  While not nearly as long as the new Snapdragon chips, this laptop did stay powered up for the entire workday with plenty left in the tank when I plugged it in for overnight charging.

During operation, there was some fan noise, but overall it was minimal and not loud.  The laptop also ran nice and cool.

I do like the number of ports on the laptop.  The right side has a USB-A and headphone jack, while the left side has another USB-A, an HDMI out, and 2 USB-C ports (one of whcih is Thunderbolt).  The matte finish of the laptop case gives it a sleek and modern look.

Out of the box, there was a lot of HP bloatware.  While some of it is useful, I found a lot of it to not be useful.  Uninstalling it took a few minutes and was easy.

Overall, the HP Omnibook X 2-in-1 is a nice package.  It has a premium feel and a really nice display.  The battery life is very good and the system overall is peppy.  1TB of storage is also very generous.  I would have preferred a dedicated number pad and more premium speakers.  I also thing the laptop is a little heavy for a 2-in-1.",0.16332213289356148,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I have been a long-time fan of HP brand of laptops and even desktops prior to that. I appreciate the high-quality work and parts that they use when manufacturing their latest touch-screen laptops.  I had a good HP laptop that was about 5 years old prior to obtaining this brand-new HP OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1 which has Copilot+ on it but also HP’s own version of an AI tool that comes in handy for the work I do. I was impressed when I unboxed this laptop and saw how beautiful the touchscreen appeared and that it was easy to flip it from a laptop to a tablet type of laptop with a great touch screen. This is my first flip version of an HP laptop so I was hoping it would meet and exceed my expectations with the graphics and sound quality, and it did. I was impressed with the wide16-inch 2k Touchscreen with Ips because it produced a sharp enough image that was a pleasure to stream movies on as well as playing occasional games and then producing my regular work.

I do like using the windows Copilot product since it is available on laptops and my mobile devices as well. I was hesitant to use it at first but over time I have become more at ease by making sure the settings are at a level I am comfortable with as far as sharing or storing any of my information. 
The processor that HP decided to put in this model is the Intel Core Ultra 7 256v Processor with Intel Ai Boost (47 Npu Tops) that is perfect for power users, people who create multimedia presentations, along with those who need to multitask on several programs at once without causing the laptop to get bogged down. They also loaded the laptop up with 16gb Lpddr5x Memory (ram) which makes it run smoothly no matter the task you are performing. I also liked that for the high-quality graphics card they chose is the Intel Arc 140v Gpu (8gb), which they combined with more AI abilities to create even better-looking images.

One of the most important features I look for in a laptop is the available storage and this one has 1 TB SSD storage which is my favorite and I have still not been in a situation where a 1 TB was not enough storage, for me it is plenty and if for some reason in the future I end up saving too many large multimedia creations I might just switch to storing some of the date in a cloud service I subscribe to.

In regard to the sound setup they used DTS: X Ultra Technology which they claim is spatially accurate, that makes it sound like 3D sound in whatever type of media you are watching. They added in a special sound system called the Poly Studio with dual speakers that is a mix of AI that can be pitch perfect according to the company literature but stood out to me when I was testing the webcam and trying out the settings available in the Poly Studio.

Now in terms of Wi-Fi the laptop comes with a 6e (2x2) standard setup that can also operate in the 6 GHZ band which I use the most on my home network but also use Wi-Fi 7 which is backwards compatible and works great with this laptop. In terms of Bluetooth technology they used a 5.3 Wireless Card.

The last area of importance from the company specifications is all the various ports they have included on the laptop. 1 Thunderbolt 4 With USB Type-C 40Gbps signaling rate, USB Power Delivery, DisplayPort 2.1, HP Sleep and Charge), 1 USB Type-C (10Gbps signaling rate, USB Power Delivery, DisplayPort 1.4a, HP Sleep and Charge), 2 USB Type-A (10Gbps signaling rate), 1 Headphone/microphone combo, 1 HDMI 2.1.

They included a 65 W USB Type-C power adapter, and the dynamic laptop only weighs a little more than 4lbs which is a nice relief to carry vs heaver older models.

I have had so much fun exploring all the various features of the new laptop but also the next gen AI apps that they included for entertainment and creativity. I would recommend this laptop to my friends and family because of how much HP packed into the lightweight laptop yet used the latest technology to make it stand out even more.",0.324457486957487,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"The OmniBook X Flip is an attractive machine. It feels fairly light, has a spacious keyboard and respectable trackpad, and had an ‘edge-to-edge’ style screen with thin bezels - all of which create a nice impression for a new laptop in 2025. A quality processor and Windows’s Hello compatibility (and the conveniences that come with it) are also solid inclusions… It’s unfortunately in the screen quality and speakers that hold this machine back from achieving greatness.


__ Screen and Speakers:  __

Before getting into more of the positive aspects of this machine, I want to call out the main detractors that make me unlikely to recommend it, despite it otherwise being a well designed and capable machine. - At 1920 x 1200, it’s not quite the true 2K resolution that HP lists, but really a standard 1080 HD screen with a bit more height to it (i.e. 1200 instead of that 1080). That added height can let you see a bit more of a webpage before scrolling or feel more natural if holding it as a tablet in portrait, but at 16” in size, the density of those pixels start to be noticeable in a way that it wouldn’t on a smaller, say, 14” screen. I’d say it’s actually ok and passable here, but that’s not the end of my gripes with the screen. The panel quality is mid-tier in general, achieving only 400 nits, a point at which you’ll probably be fine in most circumstances, but under bright lights, it may not feel bright enough. It’s also edge-lit, and while that’s not terrible, it can leak light in from the edges slightly irregularly on a black screen. Viewing angle is also not the best (despite being an IPS panel), getting a bit blown out when viewed off-angle. 

I’d argue that the screen is one of the most important aspects of any new machine, and while I appreciate that much of the cost of creating this laptop went to improving other aspects, like fast Ram and a good, AI-ready CPU, the screen is equally important not to skimp on, IMO.

Similarly, my next point of contention… the speakers. I didn’t experience audio at the quality that HP states in their description. Despite firing up Poly Studio and taking all of the suggested software updates, audio remained flat in a signature ‘laptop speaker’ kind of way, lacking bass, but otherwise able to get loud enough without terrible distortion. In comparison to my other machines, it’s near the bottom in terms of sound quality. 

Despite its large screen, these two misses makes this machine better for productivity than media or games.


__ Design & Portability: __

Even with my emphasis on the above, this laptop otherwise excels in a lot of other ways. First in its design. It simply looks the part of a modern machine. While large at 16"", if feels good and fairly light in the hand. The rear hinges seem solid and it has an overall, professional look - including its dark grey metallic body, large keys, and modern typeface on each key. Despite being only 5MP, its webcam is fairly respectable, capturing my lighter skin tone well and in better clarity than some of my other machines. And maybe more importantly is its inclusion of Window’s Hello compatibility, allowing you to easily sign in with this webcam by simply positioning yourself in front of the machine. This convenience went even further as Chrome made it easy to use this feature to fill in passwords online as well. These little things can really add up in a positive way. The included charging cable is also attractive, though much more bulky than it needs to be. Luckily, charging vis USB-C means that more compact third-party chargers will work just as well. And finally, an integrated webcam shutter is icing on the cake.


__ Quality CPU, Ram, and Integrated Graphics: __

Much of the other internal components are quite respectable. It’s modern Intel Core Ultra 7 processor with NPU make it AI ready, while 16GB of fast DDR5 ram is plenty good enough for the vast majority of people. Intel’s integrated Arc 140V graphics can handle some mid-tier 3D games much better than earlier versions of integrated graphics could. I saw frame rates around 40-50fps, but not without some ‘tearing,’ skipped frames or stuttering at times. In other words, gameplay with a lot of motion was not a smooth as it could be, but still performing without issue on less intensive games. Wifi 6E is good for higher speeds and handling places where wifi may be saturated or where interference with other machines may be a more likely. Lastly, the included Thunderbolt 4 allows for connecting up to two 4K displays with a single cable - not bad if you want to set this up as your desktop as well.


__ Summary: __

HP has created a modern, attractive machine with a lot of good components, but without a better screen… and to some extent, better speakers, I would personally aim to spend a bit more to get improvements there. If you’re looking for a machine for work, these aspects may not matter as much to you. It still excels in a lot of ways with small design features that will add up to a better experience than you might have otherwise had - from Windows Hello login, presence sensing, an integrated webcam shutter, a large screen in a taller aspect ratio, and more. 



*** The Good Stuff ***

- Professional looking modern design, relatively lightweight.
- Large keyboard with larger typeface on keys.
- Higher tier CPU.
- Fast DDR5 Memory.
- Long battery life.
- Windows Hello convenience in its decent webcam.
- Integrated webcam shutter.


*** The Less Than Good Stuff ***

- Mediocre screen and pixel density.
- Speakers lack bass, sound a bit tinny or hollow.",0.2058793290043289,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"CONCLUSION 7.35/10:

I think one of the most important metrics in a laptop is how it feels to use. Do you look forward to opening it up and getting on it or not? And for this guy I do enjoy using it. It has a sleek look. Made from aluminum. It is relatively lightweight for its size. I really enjoy the keyboard. The trackpad is good enough. The 2-in-1 feature is nice in certain scenarios. The main weak points are the speakers and screen resolution/color accuracy/refresh rate. You’ll need to decide what your priorities are. If it’s a high-quality screen, with high refresh rate, and high color accuracy, then look for the OLED model. If you are looking for a large 16-inch laptop at a very respectable price for the amount of storage, RAM, CPU, and battery life then this is a good choice. Overall, this device does more things right than it does wrong making it a solid choice. But maybe not the best choice for the money. 

SCREEN 5/10:

The screen is the most important aspect to me as it is the thing you interact with the most. This screen is quite the conundrum. Doing some things well but other things poorly. It’s a 16-inch IPS, LED, 1920x1200 (full HD), 16:10, 60 Hz, touchscreen, edge-to-edge glass, micro-edge, up to 400 nits, and 62.5% of the sRGB color range. 62.5% sRGB is unacceptable seeing as almost all other laptops near this price range support 90 – 100% of the DCI-P3 range (which is about 15% more colors which is a lot). Making everything look washed out. Which for a 16-inch screen that most will want to watch media on seems like a massive L. Contrast is much better than expected, which helps save it. 1920x1200 is a bit low just because it makes things a bit fuzzy on this big of a screen. This also helps save battery life. It comes with all the pros/cons of typical IPS screens. 60Hz seems low to me in 2025. Overall, this is a low-end display. But performs very well in its low end display category. And is the thing I dislike the most about this laptop. As if this was better, this would be such a better machine. I recommend looking for the OLED variant. As it would be worth the upgrade in the long run. With it being IPS I would have liked to see higher brightness than 400 nits which is OLED territory. 

TRACKPAD 6.5/10:

They trackpad is the second most important aspect, as if it sucks, the laptop is useless, as I use laptops for their portability and carrying a mouse around limits that greatly. This one is large, with a unique plastic-like texture, non-uniform click, where the bottom it is easier than the middle, with nothing on the top. Despite how it feels, which I think is lower end, it is still accurate. It has a hybrid feel where it feels like the bad old-school windows trackpads, but has the new-school accuracy. But lags behind MacBook’s force touch trackpad or the Microsoft Surface 7’s precision haptic touchpad. 

KEYBOARD 8/10:

The keyboard is the third most important aspect to me. With the size of this laptop, I’d expect full-size keys, but that isn’t the case. The delete key being left of the power key is frustrating. Thankfully, the power key requires more force. Shortcuts are unique and include: projecting your screen, emoji, screen brightness, backlight (its white, low or high brightness, 30 sec, 3 min, always on options which is great) that is very uniform, volume mute (has LED when muted), volume up/down, mic mute (has LED when muted), play/pause, quick launch Omen or MyHp app, screen shot. All keys are perfectly flat, requires moderate/severe pressure to depress, and very strong spring back up which I love. It is louder than a lot of other laptops. Where if I’m in a quiet room (work, school lecture) people can hear me typing. Overall, the more I use it the more I enjoy it. 

BATTERY LIFE 9/10:

Battery life is also critical in a portable machine. The latest chips have significantly improved this. I had a hard time testing this adequately. Which is a good thing. Out of the five days of testing I never ran out of juice. I was able to get through 4 hours or work (50- 60% brightness, keyboard backlight on, doing nothing to the stock settings, mixed use of watching videos, word documents, emails, multiple things open, webpages, not caring what I was doing, etc.) and it would be at like 70 – 80%. Making me expect with mixed usage and light/moderate workloads probably leading to 8 – 10 hours of battery life easy. Probably closer to 12 – 13. With much more if watching battery and just doing video playback. So this will easily get you through a workday and/or school day without any issues. HP claim 23 hours of video playback and 15 hour and 45 minutes with mixed usage. Also, supports up to 50% quick-charge in 45 minutes. 

SPEAKERS 6.5/10: 

With a big chassis I expected better. They get very loud but are very tinny. They lack bass. Making it so I can understand things just fine. They get plenty loud. However, due to their treble focus they can start to hurt my ears after a while. It comes with Bluetooth 5.3 and a headphone jack so they should fix/mediate that issue if you have those. 

2-IN-1 FUNCTIONALITY 9/10:

This I would say is one of the main selling points of this laptop. As if you aren’t going to use it then its better to go with an alternative as I think part of the price is tied up in this. The touchscreen on this is excellent. Very accurate and the glass is smooth making it enjoyable to interact with. Switching to “tablet” mode is quick, easy, and works every time. If you rotate the device it will automatically rotate the screen. I found this is awesome for three tasks. 1. When you are watching something being able to get a different angle or closer and then go through touch is a unique and pleasurable experience. 2. When you are reading a document, scrolling, or browsing content going into tablet mode is a lot of fun. But this device is big and heavy which detracts a bit. 3. If you buy the stylus from HP (which I think is like $60) you can also take notes on this device. Which may work great for some people depending on their workflows. For a student I think that would be great if you aren’t buying an iPad and wanting digital notes. I also found that when using this as a secondary screen (for example I’m referencing something often while doing something) this 2-in-1 feature really shines. 

PERFORMANCE 7.0/10:

This comes with the Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2, 256V, 8-cores, 8 thread, w/ 4.8 ghz boost, and 47 NPU TOPS. Which equates to an upper-mid range to high-end laptop. Being similar in performance to Apple’s MacBook Air M3 on Cinebench at least. It also comes with Intel Arc 140V graphics card with 8 GB of VRAM. Meaning you’ll be able to play a lot of modern games at around 30 – 60 fps at very low settings. But the cooling may be an issue as single fan that I never heard. Along with being able to video edit simple to moderate complexity (one to two video streams ideally at 4k or less with minimal/moderate effects) without any problems. However, RAM may be a limitation at 16 GB. Also, with the display having poor color accuracy you can’t trust what you’re seeing.

Testing on Cinebench showed: 
POWERED: 
Balanced: Single 1874, Mulit 10,440, 
High Performance: Single: 1890, Multi: 9557

BATTERY: 
Balanced: 
Single: 1094, 
Multi: 8498
High Performance: 
Single 1899, 
Multi-core 9698

In comparison Very High-End/premium Laptops are going to be getting 1800 – 2200 single core and about 20,000 – 30,000 multi-core. But that is usually plugged in. 

As for the SSD. It is a 1 TB SSD. In Crystal Mark I got 6139 read and 5344 write. Which is excellent for a stock SSD. The max speed you can get on Gen 4 SSD is Read of 7000 - 7500 and write of 6000 – 7000 MB/s. So we are almost there. 

The 16 GB of LPDDR5X 8533 megahertz RAM is solid. That is the minimum I would recommend but also enough that most users shouldn’t have any problems. Is the sweet spot. No complaints here. 

It boasts Wi-Fi 6E. Wi-Fi 7 is the latest standard technically. But this is awfully close so there is no real loss here. I didn’t have any problems with connecting after sleep/restart or any drops of connection. Speeds were excellent at 1484 down and 1635 up. 

FEATURES 8/10:

- It has 1x HDMI 2.1 port which I was able to get 4K @144Hz with. But couldn’t get 2560x1440 @240 Hz only 144 Hz. 
- 1x USB-C Thunderbolt 4. Able to get 4K144Hz and achieve 2560x1440@240Hz. Which also worked on the other USB-C non-thunderbolt port. 
- Via HDMI and USB-C. I was able to get my laptop display, 4K60 hz (not any higher refresh rate as it wouldn’t work), and 2560x1440 at 144Hz at the same time. For Dual USB-C I could get laptop, 4K@94 Hz and 2560@240 Hz at the same time. Which is interesting… Note with other laptops/PC I am able to get full Hz ranges and resolutions with these cables. 
- 1x USB-C 3.1 (would have preferred this to be another thunderbolt port but support same resolution as thunderbolt for external displays) and 
- 2x USB-A 3.1. Which is appreciated. Again, would have preferred to see USB-A 3.2 ideally. 
Love to see a headphone jack, which it has.
- Along with manual privacy camera shutter. 
- Already discussed the backlit keyboard. 
- Comes with a 65 watt USB-C power adapter. 
- Does NOT have a numpad. 
- Windows Hello facial: Which worked like 50% of the time for me for some reason. 

BUILD QUALITY 8/10:

Built out of aluminum. Some flex to the top and bottom, not the trackpad, where you rest your hands, or keyboard. I like that the edges are kind of tapered making it appear a lot thinner than it actually is. As where you grip is thin but where it sits is not. It requires four screws to open up. RAM is soldered. SSD is replaceable. Only one slot. As is the wireless/Bluetooth card. Otherwise stuck with what you have. Weight, for size is respectable at 4.15 lbs. Hinges are solid. With it being a 2-in-1 you have full movement. Screen stops wherever you place it. Does not bounce when typing or anything.",0.1894068287037037,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"The HP OmniBook X Flip 16-inch Laptop Next Gen AI does a good job at blending power and adaptability. Unlike a traditional laptop, its “Flipping” ability makes it a versatile machine with good hardware for many applications, and its AI feature is a welcome addition.

This model has 16GB of RAM, a generous 1TB Solid State Drive and comes equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor that is powerful enough to deliver a responsive and smooth experience for most common applications and projects. Embedded in this processor is the “Next Gen AI” feature that handles some AI-related tasks such as improving productivity within Windows, enhancing video calls experience and upgrading content creation. This is done through the AI Companion app; I tried a few features and they work as intended but I think it’s just scratching the surface of what AI assistance can truly do. It’s a bit limited in my opinion.

The 16-inch display looks big next to my 14-inch laptop. It’s a 2K IPS LED touchscreen that is responsive to the touch and provides clear visuals and dynamic colors. I’ve been enjoying watching movies and the sound quality is surprisingly good, and make long listening hours a pleasure. I also use it for work, and it handles documents and graphics images with good clarity. It can get bright enough in a well-lit environment. For external connection, it offers 2 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, 1 HDMI connection and 1 audio out connection for wired headphones.
 
The 2-in-1 design of the OmniBook X Flip with its 360-degree hinge, provides great versatility. From the traditional clamshell configuration, you can flip the screen to tent mode, or go further to tablet mode complete with the touch experience, or to reverse mode for collaboration. The hinge is solid, well built and easy to flip back and forth. It has a good build quality overall, and some people might have issues with its size at 16 inches but it’s light enough to be easily carried around in a sleeve or a backpack.

The HP OmniBook has good ergonomics suitable for everyday use. The large, well calibrated touchpad responds well to the touch. The backlit keyboard is made of good quality plastics, and is comfortable to type on and looks high-end when lit. The absence of a numeric pad is not a deal breaker, but would be welcomed. The battery has a decent duration and can go a couple of days of heavy usage before needing recharging. Only area of weakness for me was the camera that had a few issues and would sometimes not recognize me in low light environments. My other laptop cameras never had such issues. In its defense, the “AI” offered to help by registering my face; a neat feature that seemed to improve the camera’s performance.

In conclusion, the HP OmniBook X Flip laptop won me over for its versatility, solid quality build and its overall performance. Its big clear screen displays beautiful colors and its sound outshines many higher end laptops. The AI features are a plus but a bit limited for now. As long as you are not looking to play high end games or run graphic intensive software, the OmniBook X Flip comes close to being the perfect device for everything from work tasks to creative projects and entertainment.",0.21967517006802723,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I’ve realized I might have a problem- I am obsessed with finding the ideal laptop for the live I’m living. 
I’m fortunate to travel frequently and have an in-office schedule that is substantially under my control, but when I need to work (and I work on everything from design-to project management-to photo editing. What do two situations mean? 
I have to be able and inspired to perform efficiently and at a high level at any given moment, anywhere in the world. 
When the HP OmniBook X Flip arrived, I was impressed with the presentation and unboxing experience.  But that fades.  What sticks with me is this stunning recycled aluminum device is a pleasure at which to look and hold. The build is very high-quality. The touchscreen is gorgeous. It is glossy, but I haven’t been as frustrated with fingerprints as on other devices.  The charcoal colored case itself doesn’t  really show much contact at all.  This is nice since the Flip means you can effectively use the HP as a tablet.  
Don’t get me wrong though, this 16” model is hefty and needs to be conscientiously handled.  It doesn’t feel fragile, it’s simply at the max form factor for my use (your physical and working situation obviously will vary) The 14” might be optimal for most people.
That said, it is nice to have a large screen for drawing and photo reviews.  Images are crisp and vivid. I did find colors rendered differently from just about every device I have (reds in particular). I ran a color analysis and made adjustments to my own preferences.  The touch feature is responsive and enjoyable. 
So far, kudos on the build and design.  The reality these days is the competition is fierce. Once you get past that criteria, the selling points are performance and features.  I found performance to be very good with the exception of an irritating glitch at times with Bluetooth devices such as keyboards and mice.  It’s an occasional delay, and probably something that will get fixed with a device driver tweak that has not been addressed at the writing of this review. I also liked a very clear ability to cover the camera for privacy. Sound was very good, even impressive at times. 
Performance successes include an impressive battery life (so far 12-16 hours for my usage), the flip feature allows for multiple usage scenarios: laptop, tablet (keys are disabled) and viewing/working. 
Features are generous. Using Microsoft CoPilot AI, you can enjoy on-device AI research of your own documents without sharing data with HP, nor Microsoft.  There are some cool and useful video features including Magic Background, Live Stream Integration, and the ability to layer multiple video sources. 
Physical features- all good or nice: trackpad is large and responsive, Ports:  10Gbps USB B (2) and C, HDMI, USB-C Lightning and a mini headphone. 
The keyboard is large and responsive. I don’t love the feel, but it’s another personal taste item. 
Overall, I really like this devices. I seek reasons to open and use it frequently.",0.24590531942804672,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"Looking for a portable PC with the power and versatility of a desktop is relatively easy to find, until you want a touchscreen and tablet functionality, then the options start to dwindle. The HP OminBook X Flip is now available in 16"" format and promises all the features of a desktop in a relatively compact size. 

I like how thin and compact it feels and looks with the tapered edges, yet remains premium and solid. The hinges are strong and hold the screen at any angle you choose, which is especially helpful in getting the right angle for handsfree movie viewing. The keyboard is big and spacious enough for my large hands, though I'm surprised they couldn't manage a numpad in the layout. The backlit keyboard has some good light piping on both low and high settings; I like the ability to set the time the light stays on from 30s, 3min, or always. The speakers don't disappoint with very good surround simulation and loud, full range sound. You'd have to be an audiophile to not like the sound, the bass is good as expected for such small speakers, sound is projected well. You get a super-fast Thunderbolt 4 USB-3 port for up to 40gbps transfer speed and display port capability, as well as a standard USB-C and A and HDMI, and headphone jack. Really, the only thing missing is a microSD slot, but you could always get an adapter for photo and video transfer. 

My least favorite feature is the screen. While as a touchscreen, it registers multi-finger touch quick and accurately, the resolution and light dispersion leave much to be desired. Initially, when 4K came out, the xK resolution is multiplied by 2 to get the megapixels you should expect, thus a 2k would be 4Mp, 3K is 6Mp, and 4K is 8Mp. By the original definition, this would be equivalent of a 1K screen or 1080p (1200p). The light dispersion is blotchy at low illumination, clearly evident on startup, but looks fine at higher NIT and contrast settings. Color reproduction is really good for an LED. There's no separate GPU, rather an embedded Intel Arc 140v with 128MB of dedicated memory and 8GB max shared. That said, gaming is good with most titles; AI acceleration really shines at getting the frame rates you need. I got a few hiccups and ghosting while on DBZ Sparking Zero, but still better than my usual rig running an AMD Ryzen 9 extreme.
This is a well featured laptop with tablet functionality that sports built-in AI allowing for offsite computing help with demanding tasks making it appear faster than it otherwise would be. Plenty of great features rolled into this unit, and if you're not getting it for hardcore gaming or movie-binging, then the screen should be fine. Otherwise, there are other models, similarly priced that offer 3k OLED displays for less compromises.",0.20795977011494252,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I was excited to get my hands on the Omnibook X Flip 16, a 16-inch touchscreen laptop that also flips into a tablet. It's one of the new AI PCs, that has built-in AI tools to help with things like writing, organizing, and analysis. I put it to work with a variety of productivity tasks and entertainment.  The Omnibook X Flip showed little weakness, HP did a great job here!

*Design and Build*

Right from the start, this laptop's build feels premium. It’s got a dark gray metal body that looks clean, weighs about 4 pounds and is a little more than half an inch thick. Even with a 16"" screen it’s still pretty slim and not too heavy. The 360 degree hinge lets you fold the screen all the way around, so you can use it like a regular laptop, flip it into tent mode to stream videos or watch movies, or even turn it into a tablet with a touchscreen. Typing on the keyboard is a smooth experience. The keys are big and easy to see thanks to the backlighting (a few customizations on backlighting too), and feel great with satisfying feedback and a smooth click. The trackpad is large and responsive too. There are several ports to choose from which is nice considering all of the peripherals I use: (2) USB-A 10Gbps ports, (2) USB-C ports (one with Thunderbolt 4 at 40Gbps and one at 10Gbps), an HDMI 2.1 port, and a headphone/mic jack. It is missing a media slot if you are a photographer. The webcam does a great job for video calls. You can set it as high as 1080p, and even 4K if you are recording videos. It has a physical privacy shutter and supports facial recognition, which makes logging in fast. The camera can track your face and blur the background, which is great when I’m in video meetings. There is a significant amount of customization for video calls. Overall, the design and feel is premium.

*Specs and Features*

This laptop comes with an impressive hardware suite. An Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, which is part of Intel’s lineup focused on performance and AI capabilities. It has a separate NPU that can handle certain AI tasks without using the cloud. The laptop also comes with 16GB of LPDDR5x memory, which helps with multitasking and opening several apps at once. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD is quick when loading apps or opening files, and there’s plenty of space for storage. It uses Intel Arc integrated graphics, which are better than your typical built-in GPU. It won’t replace a gaming laptop, but it’s good enough to play some casual games and handle creative tasks like video editing or digital art. The Arc graphics also handled creative suites with no problems. There’s a dedicated key to launch AI tools, along with the usual media keys and an emoji key. The 16-inch 2K touchscreen (1920x1200) is vibrant, responsive and is approximately 400 nits. The screen is glossy, which makes colors pop and movies look great indoors, but can be more reflective outside if you plan on taking it out in the sun.  It also supports a stylus, unfortunately you will have to buy the style/pen separate.

*Software*
The camera has extra features like HP Enhanced Lighting and HP Camera Control, which help make video calls look better. There were a couple of preinstalled apps I didn’t need, like antivirus trial software, but those were easy to remove.

*Performance*

This laptop runs really smooth. I can have a ton of tabs open, listen to music, and work on creative suites at the same time without lag. The CPU, NPU, and memory do a great job handling multitasking.  I tested a few light games on medium settings and they ran well. It’s not made for heavy gaming, but it’s good enough for casual gaming and creative work.  The laptop stays cool most of the time, and the fans only spin up when doing something more intense like video editing. Even then, it’s not too loud and it's definitely safe for your lap. These new Intel Ultra processors are very efficient but also run very cool. Battery life is solid and HP claims more than 20 hours but that depends on what you're doing. I'm getting about 15 to 20 hours on a charge with regular use. That covers a full day for me. It also charges quickly, about half a charge in 30 minutes, which is great if you’re in a rush.

*Pros and Cons*

Pros:

Strong build and premium design

Big, bright 16"" 2K touchscreen

Powerful CPU & NPU for AI

Long lasting Battery

Comfortable keyboard and large trackpad

Fast ports 

*Suggestions/Needs Improvement*

Speakers are average

No Pen/Stylus


After spending time with the HP OmniBook X Flip 16, I can say it’s a great all-around laptop. It’s fast, it's efficient, it's powerful, and it looks great. The 2K screen is perfect for work and entertainment, and the fact that it folds into different modes makes it even more useful.  I’d recommend the HP OmniBook X Flip 16 to students, work professionals, or those looking for a versatile laptop with AI features/capability.",0.2251523243112028,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I really think computers that can fit into that ""laptop"" / ""tablet"" space really bring a lot to the table and are a great buy. But HP steps it up with their latest OmniBook X Flip as it adds some awesome specs plus the power of CoPilot AI!

PROS:
- Onboxing this laptop, it's a very visually appealing laptop! The color looks great, the material feels very upscale, and just has a nice look to it.
- My favorite part of this laptop is going to be the screen for a number of reasons! First, the bezels are super thin and I love the look it it. It also has a 2K screen which gives the color and clarity a lot of pop! Of course, the big selling point too is the touchscreen and it's very responsive and fun to use for both work and play. Lastly, it's a huge screen! 16"" on a laptop makes it great to work on either at a desk or on the go.
- On that topic, the 2-in-1 aspect works great with this. The hinge on it does not feel cheap but you can easily flip it around to go from laptop to tablet and you can put it in a number of different positions that help for creating content or viewing content.
- HP brings the typical awesome specs on top of all of that as well. It has a great processor, tons of memory, plenty of SSD storage, and just overall feels like it zips between programs while using it.
- Windows 11's CoPilot+ I have found really useful too. It helps simplify some of my work, navigate questions easier, and makes me more confident in what I am trying to accomplish. I think its a nice way to incorporate AI into every day use or specific tasks.


CONS:
- This is a great size laptop but I do think it would benefit from being even thinner and lighter than it is. Of course I understand the trade off would be less ports, but just my thought.

BOTTOM LINE:
- Having a computer that is great for sitting down and getting stuff down, as well as enjoying yourself, is something I think a lot of people want. And the HP OmniBook X Flip really brings that level of fun and work. It has a tremendous screen, awesome flip style with the touchscreen, and is loaded with top level specs. I think this will be a daily driver for a lot of people!",0.3952294685990339,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"This is a beautiful laptop and more. Sporting an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor, a nice, large 16"" (1920 x 1200) 500 nit IPS LED touch display, 5MP IR camera, a 1TB NVMe PCIe4 SSD, and 16GB LPDDR5X SDRAM, all weighing-in at 4.15 pounds, this machine sports blazingly fast performance along with beautiful aesthetics. On the outside, you'll find sufficiently robust I/O, which includes 2 USB Type-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, a headphone/microphone combo connector, 1 Thunderbolt 4 with USB Type-C (40Gbps!) that also serves as a USB charging port, and 1 USB Type-C (10Gbps) that, like the previous port, can be used for charging the laptop. To facilitate robust AI performance, this machine includes Intel® AI Boost (performing at 47 NPU TOPS).

The unboxing was uneventful. The industry trend is to park the charger and any related cables under the laptop in the box, and this product was no exception. The laptop was in a nice protective cover to help ensure that the finish was perfect out of the box.

Setting up Windows was quite easy, as that process has gotten much more streamlined over the years.

You might guess by the product name that this can be used as a tablet, and you'd be correct. It can be used in that manner. I got this laptop for my wife, and we are both ""old school"" and this laptop will most likely never see this use-case.

To be determined is battery life. HP advertises ""up to 15 hours"", but like all vendors those numbers generally do not reflect reality. If this machine gets ~10 hours between charges, I'll be happy.

HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I've been using the HP OmniBook X Flip for just over a week now, and overall, it's been a very capable and flexible laptop for my daily needs. Doesn’t lag very much when using it, very snappy and quick. I like the large touchscreen, and battery life (longest I got 15 hours). The OmniBook X is a sleek, professional-looking laptop. While it has a few quirks, especially the keyboard design, it’s a solid pick for most users looking for a powerful, modern 2-in-1.
Performance:
With the Intel Core Ultra 7 and 16GB of RAM, this laptop easily handles multitasking. I’ve used it for web browsing, video streaming, document editing, and light creative work, and it never felt slow or laggy. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of storage and keeps things snappy. Whether you're working in Microsoft Office, bouncing between 20+ browser tabs, or using AI tools like Windows Copilot or live captions, the system runs smoothly and stays cool.
Display & Media Experience:
The 16-inch 1920 x 1200 touchscreen is crisp and responsive.  The title say 2k screen but the description say FHD+. It’s not a true 2K panel (2560X1600 pixel), but it still looks great for everyday use. I watched movies at night on this laptop, and the display was bright and colorful enough to enjoy in low-light conditions. The large screen and decent color contrast make it perfect for Netflix, YouTube, or picture viewing. 
Speakers:
I was surprised by how loud the speakers are—they can easily fill a room with clear audio. Whether I was watching videos at home or listening to music while working, the sound quality was more than adequate. No external speaker needed.
Battery Life:
Battery life has been excellent so far. I’ve been averaging about 9 hours of real use (15 hour was the longest) , which includes working on documents, streaming, and general browsing. It’s more than enough to get through a full workday or a long study session at a coffee shop without needing to plug in.
Design & Portability:
The build quality feels solid. It has a premium look with the Eclipse Gray in some light finish, though I’m not entirely sure if the chassis is metal or high-grade plastic. Either way, it feels sturdy and well made. It's a bit large for using in handheld tablet mode for long periods, but great when propped up in tent or stand mode for presentations or watching shows. It’s not ultra-light, but I had no problem carrying it in my backpack and working on the go.
Keyboard & Trackpad:
Here’s the main downside for me: the keyboard. The keys are oversized and don’t have much spacing between them. It almost feels like typing on a touchscreen, and it took some getting used to. Some people may like it, but if you're particular about key spacing or do a lot of typing, you might want to test it in person. On the plus side, the trackpad is large, smooth, and very responsive.
Final Thoughts:
The HP OmniBook X Flip is a versatile and powerful 2-in-1 laptop with great battery life and a sharp, responsive display. It’s a great fit for professionals, students, or anyone needing a flexible device for both work and entertainment. Just be aware of the keyboard layout—it’s not for everyone.",0.24547522129611676,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I have owned many computers over the past 40 years, and this HP OmniBook X Flip is the best so far. From the moment I took it out of the box I knew that it is commanding of attention. It is a solid computer that looks great and has paid attention to every detail. Plug in the USC-C power supply and turn it on. The keyboard lights up and reveals the large letters on the keys and the efficient layout of the specialty keys. The large trackpad makes it easy to move around the screen or just touch the screen. The computer takes you through a series of well-designed prompts to inform the computer how you want to set it up. Once through the setup and update process, you are free to use the computer in a multitude of ways, as a laptop or as a tablet. The intel Core Ultra 7 CPU also packs a powerful GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) and NPU (Neural Processing Unit). The computer also has 16 GB of Memory and a 1 TB Solid State Hard Drive; the result is a blazingly fast computer that does everything exceedingly fast. There is not a task that I have given this computer that I was not impressed by the results. The screen is bright and clear. The keyboard has a smooth and nice tactical feedback that is confident. The battery life is impressive; I can spend the entire day on battery power without a concern. The Wi-Fi 7 speed is fast. I spend several hours a day on video conferences and the camera and performance is incredible, my other colleagues have all sorts of issues and with this computer it is all very smooth and performant. It is enabled to take full advantage of all the capabilities that Windows 11 has to offer like Windows Hello security, and CoPilot AI support. HP has managed to pack in two 10 GB USB-A ports, two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, an HDMI port, and an audio jack. This computer will not disappoint.

HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I really like this HP OmniBook X Flip 16 inch Laptop.
The processor is fast, it has plenty of SDRAM for my applications and a large capacity SSD. 
The battery lasts for hours running videos, playing app games, and surfing the internet. 
It is sleek and lightweight making it very portable. 
I love the large screen.  The touchscreen is responsive, though I did find it to be slightly inaccurate. In times of needing to tap small icons I have needed to tap a little to the left to get the appropriate response, such as tapping on the x to close windows. The on screen keyboard is large enough that it responds accurately without any adjustment on my part.
The ability to flip or stand this laptop in so many ways is great. The hinges feel strong while working smoothly.  
Videos play smooth, the speakers work great,  the 5MP camera is clear and video calls have been no problem with this machine.

HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"[PROS]

Convertible: It's a known that this laptop can be used in multiple positions. However, I did own a HP many years ago capable of the same abilities, but hinge mechanism became defective. The verdict is still out, but I find myself quite impressed with the craftsmanship thus far. I've been able to position the laptop as needed without having to constantly readjust.

Power Packed: The processor, RAM, and SSD combination that's found ""underneath the hood"" is where the OmniBook X shines. I'm able to swiftly conduct an abundance of AI requests while running other applications and store all of the files/data without a storage capacity concern. Furthermore, all the external USB ports have allowed me to conduct fast file transfers as needed.

Gaming Functionality: This is primarily a productivity device. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Intel Arc 140v GPU handled gaming with its profile. This feature might get overlooked, but the GPU adds a major benefit to this laptop. I was able to get 40 to 50fps in a large number of titles albeit with some tweaked settings. Regardless, the GPU adds another dimension to the OmniBook X.

Long Battery/Fast Charge: This laptop can go. I've been able to use it continuously for 12+ hours without the the battery dying. Charging gave it a quick boost so I don't fear the need to be tethered to a cable anymore throughout the day.

Other positives: The Poly Camera software has been nice to use during meetings. I'm fond of the changes that I can make on the fly to enhance my video. WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity has been very stable. I'm able to move about to different areas without a disruption.

[CONS]

Display Shortcomings: The resolution is nice enough, but its just a bit shy of being a QHD (1440p) screen. It has a moderate brightness level, and its definitely not the best in dealing with color.

Small nitpicks: The RAM is sufficient, but not upgradeable. The keyboard lacks a side keypad, but this can be overlooked as well.

[CONCLUSION]

From my experience, this laptop pretty much matches up with its description. I've been able to integrate the OmniBook X into my development workflow with ease. Its not perfect, but performs well.",0.23184523809523808,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,I have the laptop for less than one month and it won’t turn on. Went to geek squad and told the hard drive needs to be wiped and reset.,-0.22916666666666669,Negative
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I love the versatility of this Flipbook. The screen size is perfect in my opinion- big enough to stream movies and play games without missing any of the action, but not so big to be a hassle to carry around. The sound is surprisingly good for this type of computer. Kind of shocking how loud it can be (but not distorted at all). Processing is fast. Downloads and installs are quick. If you are a serious gamer, I'm sure you are looking for more, but for people looking for a fast, efficient, and versatile laptop/touchpad- this is it. I love the size of the keyboard buttons and layout-very easy and comfortable to use. Graphics and color are really nice. The Copilot and HP AI Companion apps are extremely helpful for whatever projects you are working on or information you are trying to find. They are always learning based on your usage and will make suggestions to help you get the most out of whatever you are trying to accomplish. Using the unit as a tablet is easy as well. The touchscreen is simple and intuitive. I think my son is going to steal this from me when he leaves for college next fall for his first-year engineering program, so I will enjoy it while I can. I highly recommend this product.",0.2379885057471265,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,I’ve been spending some time with the HP laptop. And it’s a perfect business workhorse. Straight of the box the build quality is super nice and feels great. It has great I/O ports for productivity and not needing a separate dongle just to use a USB. But also is tasteful where you aren’t slammed with way too many ports. The keyboard feels fantastic and responsive it’s has a good tactile feel which I love and the keys are fairly large which make it comfortable to use. The screen is beautiful and clear. And speaking of the screen. It flips to allow for it to be used and a drawing tablet with is super nice. But what is really cool is you are able to spin the laptop and have it stand vertically to allow for ease of use of spreadsheets and browsing. I use the laptop sideways and use a dock and have the vertical screen as my second screen while connected to a separate monitor. This laptop is perfect for work and the battery will keep up with you every step of the way. That battery lasts so long I forget that I have a charger. Definitely a great workhorse laptop.,0.49686147186147184,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"This laptop is the perfect companion for Windows 11. It is configured to work flawlessly with Co-Pilot AI and HP has its own Beta AI companion application. It looks great using as a laptop and the keyboard keys are full size and easy to use. However, there are no separate number keys or lights on the keys. The power cable is compact the power brick small is and only the size of a small power unit. The webcam has built in cover which is nice for privacy. It stands up firm and steady in tower view and works great in tablet mode also, however it is a little heavy. The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use. Setup was straightforward and it is loaded with no bloatware which is something you don't see in many computer setups. It includes a 30-day subscription to pre-installed MacAfee internet security software. The specifications give it all the power for daily tasks, work and power applications. There is 16GB of RAM and you can play basic games, but the graphics are integrated and not designed for high-end gaming. The quality of the build and the latest internal specs for running AI, will give this laptop a long future to run the latest software.",0.2768333333333333,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"HP's OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1 is an amazingly solid laptop for the price point. It's future-ready whether you're taking on a new job or heading off to school.

TL;DR:
- won't replace your gaming machine
- solid choice for your everyday productivity laptop
- high quality 2K touch display, keyboard
- slim form factor at 16"" - it's not heavy or chunky
- all-day battery life even with gaming and streaming
- out-of-the-box storage at 1TB plus integrated AI Arc graphics card
- Copilot+ is a productivity amplifier

HP's OmniBook X Flip 16 is not the most top-of-the-line gaming system or beefy maxed out production machine. It wasn't built to be that. Instead, it's meant to be a solid contender for your everyday laptop, and it's amazingly qualified for that.

The OmniBook has a sleek look - it's not clunky (just over half an inch tall) or heavy (only 4lbs), despite having solid battery life. I tested unplugged full day content creation, heavy internet usage, videos, and gaming, and still had plenty left over for the next day's work.

The onboard AI is interesting from both the hardware and software perspectives. The inclusion of a pseudo- 8GB graphics card (Arc) means that the OmniBook X can actually game by way of using the Neural Processing Unit (NPU). It's not a top of the line gaming machine by any means, but it certainly handled a fair assortment from Steam with mid to low settings. This AI chip also means that the laptop can handle an on-board HP AI agent, and it seems to come bundled with a few options for those via the HP AI software. I was pleased with the results from some simple queries that seemed to stay native to the machine. Will it outperform a live Copilot query? No, but if you're on the go and have limited connectivity, it will still do the trick... 

Speaking of Copilot+ - there are some truly interesting features that you'll want to explore which benefit extensively from the onboard NPU and since it's AI-ready out of the box, you know there's more to come as they roll out new software features. There's also a dedicated AI button on the keyboard so you can very quickly access Copilot. With Office and Edge working in tangent with Copilot+, the OmniBook X has positioned itself as an AI sandbox, if you want to use it that way - and it can really quickly bust through tasks.

Of the things that the NPU enables you to do, the most relevant to your daily usage will probably be Cocreator (generating images) and live captions. Recall is fine but you may want to opt out for privacy considerations and windows studio effects in video calls seem like a nice trick that needs some polishing. 

I found most every productivity and content creation need was capably handled by the OmniBook X - including some light graphics work, memory-heavy browser apps, and chonky spreadsheets and word documents. The 16GB of ram could be a bit higher but efficiency in power consumption was the name of the game here.

The number and positioning of the USB-C and USB-A ports didn't give me a headache. The touchpad and keyboard had a nice form factor and I felt pretty comfortable typing for an extended period. The heat distribution was also not uncomfortable extended uses. The power brick has a decently long and canvas coated cable and a small form factor, and can be easily re-routed (although only one side of the laptop has power access).

HP utilizes recycled metals and plastics on the casing and the keyboard and speaker enclosures and there was not a ton of plastic in the actual box itself.

Here's the one and only downside I've found so far: the actual audio output from the speakers was kind of disappointing. And if this was my one and only streaming device, I'd want to invest in some bluetooth external speakers or something similar.

Given that this laptop doesn't aim to be the craziest gaming machine or the most maxed out graphics slinging mobile production studio, this would be the kind of laptop I'd send along with my kids to school or something I'd want to pick up for my first job. It's a cozy laptop which gets the job done and something I can feel good about taking with me on the go, since I know it's not going to run out of power after a few hours.

The onboard AI tools are absolutely interesting and fun to work with, and you get the sense that they're gearing up for more as those features roll out.

All in all, this is a solid laptop choice for your daily driver.",0.15524094326725907,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I have been using 13""/14"" laptops for a while now and my aging eyes are starting to struggle with the smaller screens. So I wanted to give 16"" screen a try. The HP OmniBook x Flip appears to be a versatile 2-in-1 laptop that combines good performance for daily computing tasks with a twist.

Multitasking isn't an issue with Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB Ram and 1TB SSD. The Omnibook X Flip excels at multitasking and smoothly handles multiple applications without lag, providing a seamless experience for everything that I need a computer for (mainly email, web surfing office related tasks). The OmniBook X Flip has an integrated graphics, but for streaming videos and basic photo editing it is sufficient. However, it is not going to suit most gamers needs or graphics-intensive tasks that require discrete graphics.

I didn't know how I would like the keyboard when I first opened the laptop, but the backlit full-sized keys are comfortable to type with and have a good travel to them making it a pleasurable experience to type on. I am typing this review on this laptop on my couch with the lights down low and I have NO problems reading any of the keys. One thing I immediately noticed was the power button just above and next to the backspace and delete buttons.  At first I thought I would be shutting the laptop down every time I'd miss the delete or backspace buttons, but it doesn't shut the laptop down unless you press and hold for a few seconds. I'd still prefer the button be a little further away from the main keyboard. The touchpad is responsive and accurately detects multi-touch gestures. Windows Hello functionality via the web cam facilitates quick and secure logins even in dimly lit environments, adding to the convenience factor. There is also a privacy shade for the webcam. Keep in mind Windows Hello will not log you in if that shade is closed.

A feature that I don't find myself using often is the laptop's 2-in-1 functionality. Holding a 16"" screen is comically large. Especially if you remember the first LCD screens were 15"". Transition between laptop and tablet mode is simple. The 360-degree hinge is sturdy and appears well built. I do use it in ""tent configuration from time to time. Having the touch screen is handy for that.

The device features a 16-inch 2K display with vibrant colors and good viewing angles. The brightness is adequate for indoor use, though users might experience some difficulty in direct sunlight or bright environments due to the glossy screen, but the screen does have a coating on it that reduces some light glare. I usually prefer matte screens to glossy, but this screen does not bother me.

The OmniBook x Flip stays relatively quiet under light to moderate load conditions. However, during more intensive tasks, the fan noise becomes noticeable, but not distracting as far as I am able to notice.

The laptop offers a standard array of I/O ports, including 2 USB-C, 2 USB-A, HDMI and 3.5mm headphone jack. Unfortunately no SD card reader here . 

Overall, the HP OmniBook x Flip 16 with Intel Core Ultra 7 is a solid choice for those seeking a powerful yet portable 2-in-1 laptop, offering excellent multitasking capabilities and a flexible design that suits a variety of computing needs while looking attractive.",0.19213659147869677,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"This HP OmniBook X Flip 16 Next Gen AI PC is part of HP's new laptop lineup and is now available with your choice of processors. This laptop has a sleek design and is engineered to be used in multiple modes - laptop, tablet, tent, and reverse. This Copilot+ PC is powered by Intel Core Ultra 7 processor powerful enough to handle all your day-to-day things and cater to your personal AI experience. It can also handle multitasking without any lag.

The laptop comes with a beautiful and bright edge to edge 16"" 2K touchscreen display that boosts crisp images and vibrant videos. There is no stylus included, but it does support one. The flexible design includes a full-size backlit keyboard with Poly Studio audio dual speakers on the side. They are pretty good for a laptop of this size. Being a Copilot+ PC, it fully utilizes Windows 11 and designed AI experiences for creativity and productivity. The included NPU helps in supporting the AI features.

There is no shortage of storage and memory. This laptop comes with 16 GB of DDR5 RAM and 1 TB of storage, both plenty enough to accomplish all your tasks. The 5 MP IR camera and integrated microphones work well with video meetings as well as with Windows Hello functionality. There is a built-in camera shutter that comes in handy when you want to turn off your camera.

As for the battery, HP states that you can get 23 hours of video playback and 15+ hours of mixed usage. I am impressed with the long battery life. I was able to use it for a few days before I needed to plug in. This will easily get you through a full day of work without worrying about recharging. The laptop comes with a 65W USB C power adapter. It also supports fast charge, which charges the battery to 50% in 45 minutes.

Despite its sleek design, the OmniBook still accommodates 2 USB C ports, 2 USB A ports, 3.5mm audio jack, and a HDMI port. The laptop can be charged using either of the USB C ports. The Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 cards are a welcome addition as they support fast data transfers.

Overall, this is a versatile laptop that can do multitude of things with a complete blend of design and performance that helps you tackle your work or creativity from anywhere.",0.28344155844155844,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I have enjoyed my time using my OmniBook Flip, it has done everything I've throw at it while staying cool and quiet. The 16"" IPS touchscreen looks great, I have grown to love the 16:10 aspect ratio. It works well in tablet mode when you have the screen flipped around, my main complaint is it is only a 60hz screen. Only other concern with the screen and aspect ratio is fitting it into your laptop bag, most are designed for 15"" or smaller these days. They were able to keep the form factor light and thin, while still offering good connectivity overall. It would have been nice if both USB C ports were 40gb Thunderbolt 4 but having at least one is still appreciated. The fast charging is nice, giving you around a 50% charge in only 45 minutes. Battery life has been good overall for light workloads certainly not married to the wall charger like Intel laptops of a few years ago. If you are into the AI boom this intel processor can do all the copilot+ stuff, some of it able to run locally for better security. If you aren't interested in using copilot it still offers great performance, between web browsing, microsoft 365 apps, and youtube I've gotten 8-10hrs consistently; not macbook good but legitimate full day use away from the plug. The webcam is nice and works with windows hello so logging in is painless and doesn't require you to type anything in. Keyboard feels pretty nice, a bit heavy to press but quiet and not cheap feeling at all. Nice size track pad completes the package; it is responsive, easy to use, and I haven't had any accidental clicks while typing. Two large upward firing line each side of the keyboard, they don't sound great but do get plenty loud. I'd recommend headphones for most use cases, bluetooth or wired with a 3.5mm plug. There really isn't much to not like about this laptop, doesn't blow you away with features or performance but has everything you need especially if you are looking for a 2-in-1 design.",0.25545822102425875,Positive
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"I found myself somewhat conflicted as I was using this laptop trying to decide how to review it. Upon first start up, light bleeding from the edges of the screen was very noticeable. Once the computer was up and running the image quality is great, but I can see how the laptop would not necessarily provide a great cinematic experience when watching movies or playing games with dark areas given the bleeding of the light from the edges.

Speaking of the screen, it is pretty big at 16"". It is also a touch screen, which is obviously a necessity given the convertible nature of the laptop. I believe the display reaches something like 600 nits, if I recall reading that correctly somewhere. It is bright enough in most indoor environments, but I am not sure how good the screen would be if using it outside.

The keyboard is a little underwhelming. Given the real estate associated with a 16"" screen, I think it was an unfortunate choice to forego the numeric keypad. Instead, the keyboard consists of what I would describe as oversized keys that seem to have less space between them when compared to a typical laptop keyboard. I am guessing this was to minimize the risk of dirt and other contaminants getting between the keys, especially when the laptop is converted into a tablet. Ultimately, the keys have a good ""springy"" bounce to them which make it easy to type on. As a touch typist, however, I found the completely flat and oversized keys a little difficult to navigate, however, as my fingers wanted to drift from the home keys and the lack of contouring or spacing between the keys made it difficult to realize. The touchpad seemed to work well, but I still prefer the tactile and ""glassy"" feel of the touchpad on a MacBook or a Surface.

The camera has a manual sliding door/window that allows you to physically block the camera, which is a nice feature for the safety/security minded. The visual indication that the window is closed is a little subtle, though, which could be annoying or appreciated, depending on the user's preference. Given the integration with Windows Hello, however, using this feature relegates the user to using a password every time to log in.

The part I have yet to figure out is the utility of being able to switch a full laptop, like this one, into a tablet. The feature works well and Windows does a decent job of accommodating either laptop or tablet mode, but at 16"", this is a big (and heavy, in my opinion) laptop. Carrying this behemoth around in tablet mode is a workout. When in tablet mode, I would say the device is almost an inch thick. There is also a ridge that runs around the entirety of the screen, which can make it a little uncomfortable to use if you rest your wrists on the periphery of the screen. I also found the ""tablet"" somewhat difficult to pick up as the bottom edges (essentially, the keyboard and surrounding area) have a squared edge that sits flush with the table. I found myself having to grab the tablet between the screen and ""base"" to pick it up. I also do not like the idea of sitting the keyboard flush with whatever surface I am setting the tablet on. It was easy to keep the tablet upright by adjusting the angle of the hinges and it supported both horizontal and vertical orientation. Again, though, I fail to see the utility of the feature. I suppose, if I were on a flight and wanted to watch a movie, I could ""get rid"" of the keyboard, of sorts, so that it takes up less space. There is no stylus included or anything like that, so tablet mode is a touch only experience.

As for the audio, I found the sound to be a little ""tinny"" without very good bass. True, audio can be very subjective and I have learned to never expect impressive audio from a laptop, but there are some that do it better than others and this laptop is, what I would consider to be, average in this regard.

HP does include some ""shovelware"" on the device, including McAfee virus scanner (that wants you to subscribe), along with their own programs for device management (which seem to require you to have an HP account and login to the account to access many of those features). You are required to send data to HP to verify your warranty status and the pop-up to upgrade your warranty (even if it expires in a year's time) is annoying. HP also includes their AI Companion (in beta). I have no idea what that tool does differently than Windows own Copilot. (Again, you have to log in with an HP account and consent to the collection and use of personal data to use the service.)

Battery life seemed to be decent given routine use. This would probably be a good laptop for a student or a business professional using typical tools (web browsing and office-related applications). Boot up is relatively quick and responsiveness was good. (I did not run through anything too processor intensive.) There are two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and an HDMI out. No SD card and the USB-C ports were only on one side of the laptop. (No ports on the back; they were on the side only, which makes sense given the convertible nature of the laptop.) The external finish is nice with a slight tactile feel that does not appear to be a fingerprint magnet.

Ultimately, though, I was underwhelmed and would probably consider this unit to be average. Nothing horrible, but also nothing that will greatly impress. If the price is good given the specs, this would be a reasonable purchase, in my opinion. Beyond that, though, there is nothing compelling that really tips the proverbial scales to make this a must buy.",0.09383699633699631,Neutral
HP,HP 16-as0023dx,"This HP OmniBook16 inch laptop is a fairly nice machine and is certainly a step above when it comes to the typical fit and finish of typical HP laptops.  I've been impressed by the picture quality of the screen and how colors seem to pop rather vividly.  Audio quality has like wise impressed me with the level of depth that this thing generates.  Both features have really impressed me, especially when compared to what i have gotten used to from HP.  It feels sturdy in the hand and not the typical cheap plastic feel that is typical today.

 But as good as all that stuff is this thing really shines with how smooth it runs.  After the initial setup stuff this machine has some serious pep in her step.  If you are doing ""typical"" non-gaming activities in this machine you do not experience any sort of lag or hiccups during daily use.  Apps launch quick with low load times even when launching a huge spreadsheet.  The touchscreen is very responsive  and accurate to any touch inputs, either from your finger or a stylus.  Battery life has been excellent and it stays cool to the touch with the fan Hardly ever being heard.

Overall I have to admit I'm  more than a little impressed.",0.2728466386554622,Positive

I know what I wanted out of my new computer but so much has changed since my last purchase that I had no idea where to start I making a selection. So I turned to AI and asked a bunch of questions and got wonderful recommendations, including this HP Envy.

I started with a different computer that lasted a week and it was replaced three weeks ago by this Envy. Best Buy made it extremely easy to turn in the first one in favor of the Envy. It is wonderful. The 17.3 inch screen was a must have and it is terrific while easy in my eyes. Plenty of memory and processor speed.

HP,HP 17-da0013dx/9S1R7UA#ABA,"After purchasing a new HP laptop, it took two tries to transfer and copy data from the hard drive of my old computer to this new one. Yesterday, my land-line telephone rang, but I didn't get to it in time to answer. I ""star-69ed"" to find out who had called and discovered it was The Geek Squad. I called back within a minute of having not been able to answer and finding out it was The Geek Squad to spending nearly 15 minutes on the phone with a virtual operator, then someone in a call center trying to verify information that I was indeed a customer. I provided all sorts of information, including my name, phone number, work order number, passcode, etc. and still couldn't get through to The Geek Squad office in my town. Therefore, I hung up and tried again a few minutes later. After a different person answered, she did take long to verify and transfer my call to the Greeley desk where someone actually responded to tell me my laptop was ready to be picked up for a second time. After driving back to the store again, I wanted to verify the data transfer was complete and accurate. Because my old computer had a hard drive that was beginning to fail, Jack told me my data had been transferred. He tried to show me but the process was taking a long time, and before the procedure had finished he compared on-screen the data in my new laptop to the data on my hard drive -- even though he couldn't access the old hard drive. So I took my new unit home and activated it, and slowly I'm learning how to use this new laptop. Through trial and error, I figured out how to activate my mouse and keyboard, finding out I must keep a USB port continually occupied by a connector for both a cordless mouse and cordless keyboard. I've also had trouble trying to access old Microsoft Word data and create new files, even though part of the price was an Office package that was supposed to make my efforts go smoothly. They have been anything but that. I'm hoping my experiences going forward are more rewarding because I'm questioning spending more than $1,300 on a device that so far has aggravated and frustrated me. My wife and I made a big decision to go with Best Buy and The Geek Squad based on recommendations from people we know. In the next week, I'm hoping to have a better grasp of the situation, or I'll find out spending this much money and effort was indeed a waste.",0.05892255892255892,Neutral

HP,HP 17-da0013dx/9S1R7UA#ABA,"I bought this to replace an older Envy laptop. Just when I finished all of the setup and transferred my apps and files, the laptop just died. It shutdown and wouldn't power up again. I called HP to do some troubleshooting but none of it worked. They suggested I send it to them for repair/replacement. That could takes several weeks! I called BB to do an exchange because this all happened less than 2 weeks after purchase. According to the website, there weren't any available at the store closest to me. Well, I wasn't about to go driving across town to the next BB only to find out that they didn't have any. But, BB has made a change so that you cannot call the store directly to talk to a human who actually works there. Instead, no matter what store you call, you go right to a call center. Unfortunately, no one at the call center can understand or perform simple tasks. I just wanted to know if the BB store had the stock to do an even exchange. I spent hours dealing with these people via phone and chat. During that time I was transferred 6 times during the same conversation, received different answers to the same questions and my very simple problem was not solved. I returned the laptop to the closest store for a refund. Even the person at the BB customer svc desk said the call center is awful. Way to go BB. Because of your stupid policy to send all calls to a bunch of incompetent, rude idiots you lost a customer. I will not be purchasing anything from you again.  And I know one of them is going to respond to this review with a fake apology and claim to do better next time.  There won't be a next time!

HP,HP 17-da0013dx/9S1R7UA#ABA,"I have two issues with this model that would be acceptable if it were a cheaper laptop, but for this asking price these things should be better and I found them to be dealbreakers.

1. The screen is unimpressive. Text is a bit blurry, especially when using ""dark mode"" which is what I use almost exclusively. There's a noticeable lack of contrast and a general haziness that I was unable to adjust out in display settings. It is noticeable if you set this laptop next to a different brand laptop of similar tier.

2. The keyboard to me feels kind of cheap and rubbery. The keys are too soft and require to be pressed down further than most modern ""chicklet"" keyboards. It also gives the laptop a slightly outdated look.",0.07152777777777777,Neutral

HP,HP 17-da0013dx/9S1R7UA#ABA,"Replaced my 10 yr old HP Envy with this one - was always told the old tech is outdated after a few years and maybe that's true, but what I wouldn't give for my old laptop to live forever. 

Cons to this one: 
#1 con is that the graphics SUCK. Everything is hazy, nothing is sharp. When I checked the resolution, it's lower than what the settings say they are and what the laptop is sold as. 

I have a hard time believing this laptop is supposed to be the ""advanced"" choice. It's clunky. The keyboard and mouse pad feel cheap - and the mouse pad is not silent like my old one, it constantly sounds like you are brushing fabric.

I'm increasingly frustrated at how hard it is to find a decent sized keyboard on a laptop, and was really hoping this laptop would do the trick. But I will be returning it ASAP. The keys almost feel dusty/powdery. 


This is the second time I have tried to replace my old laptop, and the second time I am returning it because it's so crappy it makes my old one feel brand new despite it's 24hr updates and cranky demeanor. Maybe the tech improves drastically year after year, but the quality of the laptop itself sure goes down.",0.029020202020202016,Neutral

HP,HP 17-da0013dx/9S1R7UA#ABA,"I’ve had nothing but trouble with HP laptops, and honestly, I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. My experience has been a nightmare. After just about a year of use, my laptop completely broke down—started with random screen flickering, then the keyboard stopped responding, and eventually, it wouldn’t even turn on. It felt like it was built to fail.

What’s worse is how quickly the battery life deteriorated. I remember when I first got it, I could use it for hours, but within a year, I could barely get through a couple of hours of work before it started dying on me. It’s incredibly frustrating when you’re paying for something that’s supposed to last and it doesn’t even come close.

And don’t even get me started on HP’s customer service. Trying to get help or a replacement was a headache. It felt like they were avoiding responsibility, and I was left stuck with a broken laptop. They don’t seem to care much about their products once they’ve sold them to you.

Honestly, if you’re looking for a reliable laptop, HP is not the way to go. The poor build quality and frustrating customer support made my experience so much worse than it needed to be. I’d never buy another one.",-0.08148148148148149,Neutral

So far it has performed all the tasks I have required of it admirably and seems to be of excellent quality.
The keys on the keyboard are well spaced and respond quickly without much pressure. 
The touchpad is responsive and reasonably precise. 
The touchscreen is a convenient feature and seems more sensitive than the touchscreens on other laptops I have owned.
The battery life is a little short compared to other laptops I have used but it does recharge quickly.
Windows 11 has some unique idiosyncrasies that make the operating system a bit frustrating to work with at times (It had to update itself for four hours before it would boot the first time and it assumed it was being hacked after I checked some settings in the BIOS).

Lenovo,Lenovo 82VG00TYUS,"I’ve been using the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 for several weeks now, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. For the price, this laptop really delivers more than I expected.

The touchscreen is surprisingly responsive and makes navigation feel smooth and intuitive, whether I’m browsing the web, working on documents, or streaming videos. The full HD display is clear and vibrant, and I appreciate the extra screen space when multitasking.

What stands out most is the portability. It’s lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry to class, and for traveling. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the overall build feels sturdy.

Performance-wise, the Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of memory handle everyday tasks with ease. I use it for office apps, video calls, light photo editing, and streaming—and it keeps up without slowing down. The SSD also helps everything boot up and load quickly.

Combined with the capable AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD that handle everyday tasks smoothly, this laptop delivers both attractive design and reliable performance - it's the kind of device you'd be proud to use anywhere, as it definitely doesn't look like a budget laptop despite its affordable price range.",0.3111111111111111,Positive

The ""8GB"" ram is soldered onto the motherboard and CANNOT be upgraded. It gets worse though. Your system will not actually be given the full ""8GB"" of memory. More like 5.6 GB after the AMD graphics card allocates memory for itself. A new computer is not usable with 5 GB ram.

Lenovo,Lenovo 82VG00TYUS,"So for those who don't know, Lenovo's previous version of this laptop was an i5 with 8GB of memory.  Exact model was the 82QD00HMUS.  It was priced at $319 and you had one slot to upgrade the memory to 16GB.  Came with 512GB of storage and Intel Iris XE graphics. Perfect value laptop for what you got.   As soon as I received this laptop, I noticed that the memory is locked to 8GB and no RAM slot to upgrade to 16GB.  Even for basic users, standard should be 16GB, and for gamers minimum 32GB-64GB.  The fact you can't upgrade this to 16GB is enough for me to return this device.  Yes yes, you can gain some performance with having it soldered on, but at the end of the day, you are still locked at 8GB.  On top of that, they cut the storage in half, from 512GB to 256GB.

Sleek and Lightweight: Its slim design and lightweight build make it easy to carry around, perfect for students and professionals on the go.

Long Battery Life: The battery lasts through extended use, and the Rapid Charge Boost feature provides two hours of use with just a 15-minute charge.

Enhanced Security: The built-in fingerprint reader ensures secure and quick logins",0.35833333333333334,Positive
Lenovo,Lenovo 82XM00LMUS,"I’ve been using the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 for a few weeks now, and I’m genuinely impressed! The AMD Ryzen 7 processor combined with 16GB of RAM makes multitasking seamless—I can stream, browse, and work on documents all at once without any lag. The 15.6” Full HD touchscreen is bright, responsive, and a nice bonus for quick navigation. Boot-up is lightning fast thanks to the 512GB SSD, and there’s plenty of space for my files and apps.

The build is sleek and surprisingly lightweight for the screen size, making it great for portability. Battery life has also been solid—I can get through most of the day on a single charge. Whether you’re working, studying, or just enjoying media, this laptop delivers excellent performance at a great price point. Highly recommend it!",0.47574404761904765,Positive
Lenovo,Lenovo 82XM00LMUS,"As a full-time teacher, I needed a laptop that could handle lesson planning, virtual meetings, grading, and a bit of multitasking without slowing me down. I recently purchased a Lenovo laptop, and so far, it’s been a solid investment.

The setup was simple and straightforward, and I appreciate how user-friendly the interface is. It runs smoothly even with multiple tabs open—whether I’m toggling between Google Classroom, PowerPoint, or student data portals. The keyboard is comfortable for long stretches of typing, and the battery life easily gets me through the school day without needing a charge.

One of the things I like most is its durability. I carry it back and forth between home and school, and it’s held up really well. It’s not overly heavy, which is a bonus when you’re already carrying papers, a lunch bag, and everything else that comes with the job.

While it’s not the flashiest device on the market, it gets the job done efficiently—and that’s exactly what I need. If you’re a fellow educator looking for a dependable, budget-friendly laptop that can keep up with the demands of teaching, I’d definitely recommend checking out Lenovo",0.13251633986928105,Positive

Lenovo,Lenovo 82XM00LMUS,"I’ve been using the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U for a little while now, and overall, I’m pretty happy with it. For the price, it feels like a solid deal especially with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD packed into a slim and light chassis. The Arctic Grey color looks clean and modern too.

Performance-wise, it handles multitasking easily. I can run several tabs, documents, and apps without any slowdown, and it stays pretty quiet while doing it. The Ryzen 7 gives it a nice boost in speed definitely not sluggish like cheaper laptops I’ve used in the past.

The touchscreen is a nice bonus. I didn’t think I’d use it much, but it’s surprisingly handy for scrolling and quick taps when I don’t feel like using the trackpad. The display itself is Full HD and clear, though the brightness could be better if you’re working in a really sunny room.

Battery life is decent but not amazing. I get through most of the day on a single charge, but if I’m doing more intensive tasks, I’ll need to plug it in sooner.

If I had to nitpick, I’d say the speakers are just average and the build is more plastic-y than premium, but again for the price point, you can’t expect a MacBook build quality.

Bottom line: It’s fast, reliable, and has great specs for what I paid. It’s a great everyday laptop for work, school, or casual use. If you’re not super picky about ultra-bright displays or high-end materials, this is a great buy.",0.21985653235653238,Positive

Lenovo,Lenovo 82XM00LMUS,"Lenovo has always impressed me in terms of their signature keyboard layout and performance for the price. The 512GB SSD is just enough for basic programs, projects. etc. 16GB of RAM is above average but the bloat and AI in Windows will still see you at 40-50% usage with a web browser running. The AMD Ryzen 5825U is just enough power for basic Lightroom editing while maintaining good battery life. My only gripe is the industry average build quality. Don't lift it with one hand on the bottom near the keypad because it will start clicking things on your screen since the frame flexes. This is perfect for daily browsing and simple editing that should last about 3-4 years before becoming too obsolete.",0.184375,Positive

Lenovo,Lenovo 82XM00LMUS,"Lenovo continues to deliver solid, reliable laptops, and this model is no exception. It offers a great balance of performance, build quality, and affordability.

One of the standout features is the keyboard – it’s comfortable, responsive, and ideal for long typing sessions. The overall design is sleek and minimalistic, with a sturdy feel that doesn’t make the laptop too heavy to carry around.

The Full HD display produces sharp visuals with decent color accuracy, suitable for everyday use, media consumption, and even some light creative work. Under the hood, the latest Intel/AMD processor combined with ample RAM handles multitasking and moderately demanding applications without any noticeable lag.

Battery life is respectable, lasting around 6 to 8 hours with average use. Connectivity is also a strong point — the range of ports is versatile, reducing the need for extra adapters or dongles.

If there’s one downside, it’s the built-in speakers. They’re serviceable for basic tasks but lack depth and volume. For better audio, external speakers or headphones are recommended.",0.215,Positive

The 15.6"" Full HD touchscreen is responsive, and I’ve found it really handy for quick navigation. The screen looks sharp, but the viewing angles aren’t the best — if you're sitting off to the side, the colors do fade a little.

Performance-wise, the AMD Ryzen 7 and 16GB of RAM make multitasking super smooth. I can have several tabs open, watch videos, and use office apps all at once without any lag. The 512GB SSD is a nice touch too; it boots up quickly and has plenty of space for everything I need.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on, though the key travel could be a little better. I do a lot of typing, and I’m pretty happy with it overall. The trackpad works well too — it’s responsive and supports multi-finger gestures, which is nice.

Battery life is decent — I usually get about 7 hours of use, which is fine for most of my workday. Heavy tasks like streaming or video editing will drain it faster, but for general use, it holds up well. Plus, the fast charging feature is super handy when I need a quick boost.

If you're looking for a laptop that’s good for browsing, working, or watching shows, this one definitely delivers.

I recently purchased the Lenovo Yoga 7i, and it has been a fantastic experience so far. The 2-in-1 design makes it incredibly versatile, switching seamlessly between laptop and tablet modes. Its Intel Core processor and ample RAM handle multitasking and demanding applications effortlessly.  

**Pros:**  
- Premium build quality with a sleek, lightweight design  
- Excellent performance for productivity and light creative work  
- Vivid touchscreen with responsive pen support (if included)  
- Great battery life lasting through a full workday  

**Cons:**  
- Limited port selection (could use more USB-C/HDMI)

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"The Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 has been exceptional in performance.
It has seamlessly supported my academic tasks and software development projects without any interruptions.

Running multiple instances of Intellij and database engines on the Ultra 7 processor along with the 16 GB soldered RAM has been smooth and efficient.

Its versatility shines when I switch it into tablet mode, where the physical keyboard is automatically disabled, enhancing the user experience.

It is very fast in terms of processing, maybe being enhanced by the combination of an Ultra processor, soldered RAM and SSD storage.

I also like the touch screen which works conveniently when you do not want to use the mouse, which gives you a lot of options. 

I recommend it for school and business, and would recommend a friend too, excellent battery life of over 8 hours depending on usage and processes.",0.2474074074074074,Positive

One small concern is it was surprisingly lagging during watching 2k and 4k videos on YouTube. Apart from that, have no significant complain. All in all, if you are looking for a good laptop for your college or professional work, you certainly can consider this one.

And yes, this laptop comes with good discount occasionally. I bought this one in Black Friday deal at $699 +tax. Which surely, is a sweet spot for this kind of spec.",0.29066416040100246,Positive
Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"Si far I’ve really enjoyed the versatility! For the price range this product has gone above and beyond. For some background I’m coming from Apple - had a MacBook Pro at one point which I scaled down to an iPad Pro and used that the last 5 years. Recently making the switch and choosing Lenovo based on prior research, specs, value and brand. 

This laptop I use primarily for emails, light work, notes and some simple business software (Mindbody, canva, adobe). It’s vibrant, easy to use, can be used as tablet which is cool cause I feel like I never had to stray too far from how my iPad felt. I have the pen now and it’s been nice to use and have that option when I switch from work to note taking or highlighting. But I love how I can use it on the go in different positions and orientations! Makes working from my car or outdoors or in transit easy!

Keys are smooth and responsive not overly clicky but good to the touch so far. I like the fingerprint scanner when it works which is most of the time. Sometimes it just can’t read my finger print so it could be me but otherwise the facial recognition feature pretty much works all the time so it’s never been an issue. 

I like the feel of the touch pad and is responsive as well it does offer a different feel than if you’re coming from MacBook. 

Overall I’m used to most of the aspects and the switch and glad I did. If you’re wondering why I switched it was sheer value and price point at the time. I didn’t really see the need to buy a 1200$ computer when I used it infrequently just approx 2x a week really. My iPad needed upgrading it being 5+ years old so I shopped around for some PCs and windows based laptops. Happy with that so far.

Rating: ★★★★☆
Title: Warranty Saved My Lenovo Yoga

I’ve owned my Lenovo Yoga for about a year, and while it’s an amazing laptop with great performance and flexibility, I ran into an unexpected issue with the touchscreen. Thankfully, I had purchased the extended warranty.

The repair process was smooth—Lenovo’s customer service was helpful, and they guided me through every step. I shipped it out, and it was repaired and returned quickly. The warranty definitely saved me from an expensive repair bill.

My only complaint is that I wish the warranty process allowed for in-store fixes instead of shipping it out, but overall, it’s a great investment to protect such a versatile device. Highly recommend pairing the Lenovo Yoga with their",0.16611111111111113,Positive

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I've been using the laptop for almost five days now and I am so far impressed:
*Speed: Number 1 need in a computer is for it to complete the operations quickly and consistently, without getting bottlenecked. This laptop does that. I'm not a gamer, so I cannot speak to that, but for my uses of working with many documents and tabs opened at the same time, internet searches, creating slideshow presentations, and streaming, it does the job. It did have a small problem with buffering when streaming a live sport's game (which also happens with my older laptop) but I'm not sure if it is partially a modem problem; all pre-recorded events/shows it streams really well. 

*Battery: Reviews are really positive about the battery for this Yoga 7 but do not give precise data to confirm or deny the claim of 10-12 hrs of Lenovo. I was first disconcerted because it seemed to be draining much faster than advertised, but I believe I found out that this laptop continues to drain at a fair rate when just left in ""sleep"" while I was myself sleeping. I reset the setting so that the computer ""hibernates"" when closing the screen or I just completely turn it off to completely save the batter (over night). 
Then, in my batter test, I saved additional power by turning off the bluetooth device. Overall, I was able to go from 100% to 25% with about 10 hours of use (with wifi on that entire time). However, if I didn't have the screen on fairly dim for at-least a few of those hours, I don't believe I would have reached more than 8 hours of use. 

*Screen: My wife and I have been quite impressed with the sharpness of the display, much better than our multiple year older quality laptops, even though the Yoga display is just advertised as being more entry-level. 
Screen-size: My last two laptops were 14"" and I like the width of this 16"" one, esp. when I'm working on it without the help of my exterior monitors.
Exterior monitors hooked up really well the first time, whether using the hdmi connection or my adaptors to the usb-c or the usb ports. Graphic conveyance to the exterior monitors do not have a noticeable lag; both my exterior monitors are basic under $100 each.

*Keyboard: I like that it has a full number pad on the right, when needed. Backlit keys are helpful and the shortcut of  fn-spacebar is really nice, rather than on my HP where I have to find that particular key above the numbers when it is already dark. I haven't gotten use to consistently be able to ctrl-v or ctrl-c, which I do a lot, and a third of the time it didn't work the first time (probably not touching the right buttons smoothly), hopefully I'll get use to the new button locations.

*Bloatware: It did come with some that I've needed to take time to remove but it does not seem excessive.",0.18122192273135668,Positive

Title: Lenovo Yoga 7i 16"" - A Versatile 2-in-1 with a Stunning Display
Review:
I recently purchased the Lenovo Yoga 7i 16"" 2-in-1 laptop from Best Buy, and I'm very happy with it so far. I primarily use it for work and creative tasks, and it has been a fantastic upgrade from my old machine.
Pros:
 * Beautiful 2K Touchscreen: The 16"" 2K touchscreen display is the star of the show. It's bright, sharp, and vibrant, making it perfect for watching movies, editing photos, or just browsing the web. The touch functionality is responsive and accurate, and the 2-in-1 design allows me to use it as a tablet when needed.
 * Powerful Performance: The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD provide plenty of power for demanding tasks. I can easily multitask between multiple applications, edit large images, and even do some light gaming without any lag.
 * Long Battery Life: I can easily get through a full workday on a single charge, which is essential for me.
 * Solid Build Quality: The laptop feels well-built and sturdy, with a premium aluminum chassis.
 * Versatile 2-in-1 Design: The 360-degree hinge allows me to use the laptop in various modes, including laptop, tent, stand, and tablet. This versatility is great for presentations, watching movies, or taking notes.
 * Excellent Keyboard and Trackpad: The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with good key travel and backlighting. The trackpad is also large and responsive.
Cons:
 * A Bit Heavy:  At around 4.6 lbs, it's not the lightest 16"" laptop out there. If portability is a top priority, you might want to consider a smaller model.
 * Limited Ports: While it has essential ports, some users might find the selection limited, especially if they need more USB-A ports.
 * Speakers Could Be Better: The speakers are decent but not amazing. They lack bass and can sound a bit tinny at higher volumes.
Overall:
The Lenovo Yoga 7i 16"" is a fantastic 2-in-1 laptop that offers a great combination of performance, versatility, and portability. The stunning display, powerful performance, and long battery life make it a great choice for work, entertainment, and creative tasks. While it's a bit heavy and has limited ports, the pros far outweigh the cons. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium 2-in-1 laptop.

I do 3d printing and often use the Bambu Labs software to render and slice objects and it does it faster than my desktop computer (although note my desktop computer has a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU). When under load from games is when it starts to stress. Opening even Ballon Tower Defense 5 will kick the fans on, although so far there aren't many performance issues when the game is running.

Astroneer saw a lot of performance loss even at the lowest settings and a medium-sized base, although it ran well at the lowest graphics with a starter base. Risk of Rain 2 sees similar results.

These wants are nothing too crazy but I was surprised at how many laptops didn't check off all specs. I wanted to stay somewhat future-proof, as I am not one to buy a new laptop every 2-3 years. This checks off all the boxes and the fact that it's a 2-in-1 is a nice bonus. It has a solid-build feel to it (read: heavy).
I did buy an Acer during Prime week for a similar price and most specs were comparable. But when I compared speaker quality side by side though, there was no contest this laptop sounded way better. I ended up returning the Acer. I know the Yoga doesn't have the best sound quality across all laptops but knowing this one is far from the worst gave me peace of mind.

I have had the laptop for a couple months now and the battery strength is excellent, the computer is easy to use and it’s not too heavy for traveling. I’m really glad I made the switch. I have the total tech membership and was able to do a price match a couple weeks after I purchased the laptop when it was on sale for $300 less, making it an extremely great deal! The geek squad at Best Buy was amazing as well. Highly recommend both the Lenovo laptop and using the geek squad to transfer your computer data and set up your new laptop.",0.32948567305710164,Positive

I particularly enjoy the powerful Dolby Atmos sound and its ability to run my development tools such as Visual Studio 2022 and SQL Server. The convertible form factor is convenient and versatile, and it works seamlessly with my HP Thunderbolt dock. It's important to use a Thunderbolt cable instead of just a plain USB-C, as I encountered some initial issues that were resolved when I switched to a new cable. The laptop easily connects to my two screens and works well with a pen for note-taking. It's lightweight, making it perfect to carry around or set up in tent mode. It's also a great option for students, especially when it goes on sale at a reasonable price. After using my previous laptop for six years, it feels refreshing to upgrade.

2. the trackpad gets a C+. It's off-center of the overall hardware but centered with the alpha side of the keyboard. Takes some getting used to. Down click is somewhat resistant. 
3. ctrl and fn buttons are positioned backwards IMO (or the ctrl should be bigger) making the ctrl button less-than-desirable for copy/cut/paste functions 
4. the keyboard isn't backlit

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I’ve been looking for a laptop that can keep up with a busy life, juggling work, school, maybe some creative projects, and downtime with streaming or catching up on emails. The Lenovo Yoga 7i really stands out as a strong contender, especially if you need flexibility, performance, and a large screen without entering high-end price territory.

Pros:
• 2-in-1 Flexibility That Actually Feels Useful: The 360° hinge isn't just a gimmick; I loved being able to flip it into tent mode to watch Netflix at night or prop it up in tablet mode to sketch or jot down ideas. It feels natural and smooth to switch modes, which makes multitasking easier.
• Gorgeous 2K Touchscreen: The screen is bright and crisp, with colors that truly pop. Whether I’m on Zoom, reviewing documents, or watching YouTube, the quality makes everything more enjoyable. The 16:10 aspect ratio gives extra screen real estate that's great for side-by-side windows or spreadsheets.
• Fast, Responsive Performance: The new Intel Core Ultra 7 handled everything I threw at it, streaming, browsing with way too many tabs open, and working on documents, all without slowing down. It feels quick and smooth. For me, the 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD are more than enough, making a noticeable difference in speed and storage space.
• Battery That Lasts All Day: I didn’t find myself chained to a charger. I could get through most of the day without thinking about the battery, which is huge when you're on the go.
• Solid, Sleek Build: It looks and feels like a premium laptop, with a sturdy, minimalist design and a professional appearance. The Storm Grey color is understated but really sharp.

Cons:
• It’s a Bit Large for a Tablet: The 16” screen is amazing for working, but it’s not exactly something you want to hold in your arms like an iPad. That said, it’s perfect on a desk, couch, or stand.
• Not for Gamers or Heavy Video Editing: It runs programs flawlessly every day, but if you’re looking to game or do advanced video editing, this isn’t the machine for you. There’s no dedicated graphics card.
• Ports Are Limited: You’ll likely need a USB-C hub if you prefer having HDMI, SD card slots, or additional USB ports. I didn’t mind this, but it’s something to plan for.
• It Can Get Warm During Heavy Use: I noticed the fan kicks in when I’m multitasking heavily. It’s not excessively loud, but worth mentioning if you’re noise-sensitive.

If you're someone like me who wears multiple hats, student, professional, parent, counselor, the Yoga 7i really meets you where you’re at. It’s powerful, reliable, and doesn’t feel overly complicated. It supports productivity and personal time, which is rare to find in one package.  This laptop makes a strong case for being your next everyday companion. It handles Zoom calls, Google Docs, research, Netflix, and everything in between with style and ease. For the price point, it gives a great balance of power, design, and features. It’s not flashy, it just works, and that’s exactly what I need most days.",0.24280608280608285,Positive

From a performance standpoint, the laptop excels; it runs fast, loading programs and applications with remarkable speed.

One of its standout features is the ability to flip the screen around—this flexibility adds a layer of versatility that users may find exciting and practical for different scenarios.
The setup process was straightforward and user-friendly, although there was a minor hiccup with the screen brightness adjustment. However, this issue was quickly resolved by updating the driver using a tool available on Lenovo's website—a testament to the manufacturer’s accessible and effective support resources.
In conclusion, this laptop provides a seamless blend of form and function. With no complaints beyond an easily fixed setup issue, it proves to be a great purchase, leaving the user satisfied and confident in their choice. A commendable device, indeed.
The laptop runs fast, things load quickly, and the battery life is good. The flexibility to flip the screen around is very cool. Setup was easy overall, except the screen brightness wouldn't adjust.

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I had an HP Envy that I suffered with since the Windows 11 update. It was very slow for starters.

I am so glad that I found this computer. Although the memory is half of the previous one, it feels like it is 4 times faster. I don't even notice the updates in the background. It is much quieter as well.

I am always using the touch screen features for something and will never get another laptop that doesn’t have this future. The only reason I put this as 4 stars is because I have had an issue twice where the setting was changed without me intentionally doing it and the mouse disappeared. One time it occurred in the middle of me typing a project and the second time I was turning it on before class started and it was just gone.

I have had this Laptop for 2 months I am an engineering student and needed to upgrade my Asus laptop which lasted me 5 years. My friend raved about this laptop and all of it's features. Here is a list of my problems only taking this thing to school. 
 (Keep in mind it is only 2 months old) 
Cons:
-The power button does not work anymore, if it was not for all of the sensors in the computer I could not use it at all 
-The display has nasty input lag when scrolling where it looks like an ink packet exploded. In File Explorer specifically the least demanding program I know 
-It scratches just by looking at it. I keep this computer in a protective soft shell since it sits in my backpack and it is so flimsy that the paint is peeling everywhere and the frame has small deformities in it already. 
-I had to calibrate the touch input and it straight up did not work so  I had to reset it to factory defaults 

Pros:
-Its touchscreen
-The processor is mediocre (It hates MATLAB Live scripts)
-It's relatively lightweight (it weighs as much as my old laptop which was half the size)",-0.12156177156177156,Negative

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"This laptop was ALMOST perfect for me. I love the build quality, the performance, the feel of the touchpad and keyboard, etc. The speakers are also decently loud. However, for me there was one relatively major dealbreaker - the screen, color-wise, is very washed out looking, even by IPS and sRGB standards. You might not notice it in the store, but was very apparent to me at home when comparing it to other devices. Attempting to boost the color saturation in the display settings and lowering the brightness did not help this, nor did updating the display drivers or changing the color profile. The result is an image quality more comparable to VA displays on budget laptops.

I had done my research online and came in expecting to spend well over a thousand dollars on a completely different model. But the customer service rep in the computer section took the time to ask what I actually needed the computer for—and immediately knew which unit would be the right fit. They took me straight to this one and saved me hundreds.

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I waited a couple of months after purchasing this to write a review to ensure I could acclimate myself to the layout of this computer compared to others. Bottomline....I wish I would have selected a different computer. 

Let's start with the pros: It's a Touchscreen model and the touchscreen is very receptive and responds to demands. My previous computer was not TS and I missed it, so when I saw this model, decided I wanted it. 
I was a little taken back by the size when I got it as I expected it to be a little larger based on the description, but overall, the weight is good, and it is simple to transport from one place to another. 

It is called ""Yoga"" for a reason. It can be folded in a couple of different ways. When giving a brief, I fold in half to speak. No extra papers, or cards. Just a sleek component holding my notes.   

It comes with ample memory and I feel as if I have more than enough to meet my demands, including with the graphics I do online. 

I have used the camera a few times for meetings, and it works well. Images are clear and there is little to no lag time (I have horrible internet service in the country, so this is a big deal for me.) I also like the fact I can slide the little tab on the camera to an ""off"" position when not in use. 

Cons: Layout. The most annoying feature is the power button is on the right side (yes side) of the computer. If you try to move or adjust the laptop on a surface and you touch the side, boom, your computer shuts off. Using it while sitting on the sofa, touches the side of your leg or hand - off it goes again. Who in their right mind would put a power button the side? 

The top row of buttons in my opinion leaves a lot to be desired. Most computer brands are consistent with where the buttons are...not this model. Sound is all the way on the top left, there is no ""end"" button on the top row (only in the keypad which you have to have the number lock off). 

The touch pad while large, does not have defined cutoffs for left/right clicks. This a major cause of frustration. You have a super large touch pad that its usage is not as optimized as it could/should be. 

The system is overly touchy and tends to ""bounce.""  I'm typing in one place, and I end up somewhere else. It is a waste of my time and energy repeating work I've completed, especially during quick turnarounds.

Co-Pilot: I loathe and detest this feature. I don't need it and do not want it. I turn it off and as soon as I have to restart my computer, it magically reappears as if it feels I need it for my online existence. It appears in every aspect of my online experience, including email.

Speaking of having to restart. The reason I purchased a new computer is because I needed something that would process quickly. This system freezes up more than a newer system should (I think in part due to the McAfee insists I purchase additional upgrades.) I have never had to restart a new computer because it freezes as much as this one. Extremely disappointing.

While this computer is serving its purpose, it is not what I expected. I had this preconceived notion it would be better and unfortunately; it has been a frustrating purchase for me and I feel I could have spent my money differently.",0.0620873917748918,Neutral

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I’m sorry, I do not usually give 3-star reviews but I think it’s important to note that I was placed on a 12-month lease when I went to the store to purchase a laptop full price. The sales rep seemed agitated when I told him I didn’t want to lease and he convinced me that they offered a 3-month lease but instead, he placed me on a 12-month lease and quickly skipped through the fine prints on my phone when I wasn’t sure what was going on. He told me that I could change the term of my lease later to 3-months. Actually, I couldn’t. You either overpay the monthly amount due or pay off the amount in full if you wanted to end the lease sooner! I went ahead and paid the amount in full which was my original intention. So, I was put through that ridiculous process for no reason. Very misleading sales tactic. I do not have any grouses with the store which is why I’m not giving them 1-star review but would recommend training the sales rep so they do not engage in misleading tactics to gain “accounts”.",0.16861111111111113,Positive

Lenovo,Lenovo 83DL0002US,"I am giving this one star because it does not have crucial functionality that both the store AND the specs claim it has.  And, after a month and having taken all the time to reinstall programs - AND to have to buy another license for MS-Office (I don't want 365!!) I now have to return this and buy a laptop that actually has the ability to input an external microphone through a jack (not blue tooth!!!).  It cost me $175 to have a technician try and this to work (the Dell shares the headphone output jack with the microphone input jack.  He tried installing drivers, etc, only to find out that finally determine this unit DOES NOT support a line-in microphone through a jack.  Yet - the specs SAY it does have this feature.  I am really mad at Best Buy for recommending this unit to me - AND, to the Geek Squad, who dialed into my unit and after wasting two hours of my time, admitted that he was unable to figure this out and sent me to the 800 number to book an on-site appointment - something that can't be done on the 800 number.  After doing some research I decided to go back to buying a Dell, and because I have the yearly service package, I am going to expect the Geek Squad at the store that sold me this dumb Lenovo and have them reinstall EVERYTHING on the new unit - of course, once I confirm that indeed the DELL is able to support the external mic (my old Dell does so I can't see why the new one wouldn't but who knows these days...)
