      "body": "Si far I\u2019ve really enjoyed the versatility! For the price range this product has gone above and beyond. For some background I\u2019m coming from Apple - had a MacBook Pro at one point which I scaled down to an iPad Pro and used that the last 5 years. Recently making the switch and choosing Lenovo based on prior research, specs, value and brand. \n\nThis laptop I use primarily for emails, light work, notes and some simple business software (Mindbody, canva, adobe). It\u2019s vibrant, easy to use, can be used as tablet which is cool cause I feel like I never had to stray too far from how my iPad felt. I have the pen now and it\u2019s been nice to use and have that option when I switch from work to note taking or highlighting. But I love how I can use it on the go in different positions and orientations! Makes working from my car or outdoors or in transit easy!\n\nKeys are smooth and responsive not overly clicky but good to the touch so far. I like the fingerprint scanner when it works which is most of the time. Sometimes it just can\u2019t read my finger print so it could be me but otherwise the facial recognition feature pretty much works all the time so it\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nI like the feel of the touch pad and is responsive as well it does offer a different feel than if you\u2019re coming from MacBook. \n\nOverall I\u2019m used to most of the aspects and the switch and glad I did. If you\u2019re wondering why I switched it was sheer value and price point at the time. I didn\u2019t really see the need to buy a 1200$ computer when I used it infrequently just approx 2x a week really. My iPad needed upgrading it being 5+ years old so I shopped around for some PCs and windows based laptops. Happy with that so far. Will have more Apple products I\u2019m sure as I\u2019ve loved that but thinking bigger PC next if anything!",

None of my Bluetooth pens seem to work. It has been quite frustrating, to be honest.

A neighbor pointed me out, and the video from a neighbor's camera shows how the delivery driver placed the package, took a photo, and then took it back with him, confirming it as delivered.

      "body": "I've been using the laptop for almost five days now and I am so far impressed:\n*Speed: Number 1 need in a computer is for it to complete the operations quickly and consistently, without getting bottlenecked. This laptop does that. I'm not a gamer, so I cannot speak to that, but for my uses of working with many documents and tabs opened at the same time, internet searches, creating slideshow presentations, and streaming, it does the job. It did have a small problem with buffering when streaming a live sport's game (which also happens with my older laptop) but I'm not sure if it is partially a modem problem; all pre-recorded events/shows it streams really well. \n\n*Battery: Reviews are really positive about the battery for this Yoga 7 but do not give precise data to confirm or deny the claim of 10-12 hrs of Lenovo. I was first disconcerted because it seemed to be draining much faster than advertised, but I believe I found out that this laptop continues to drain at a fair rate when just left in \"sleep\" while I was myself sleeping. I reset the setting so that the computer \"hibernates\" when closing the screen or I just completely turn it off to completely save the batter (over night). \nThen, in my batter test, I saved additional power by turning off the bluetooth device. Overall, I was able to go from 100% to 25% with about 10 hours of use (with wifi on that entire time). However, if I didn't have the screen on fairly dim for at-least a few of those hours, I don't believe I would have reached more than 8 hours of use. \n\n*Screen: My wife and I have been quite impressed with the sharpness of the display, much better than our multiple year older quality laptops, even though the Yoga display is just advertised as being more entry-level. \nScreen-size: My last two laptops were 14\" and I like the width of this 16\" one, esp. when I'm working on it without the help of my exterior monitors.\nExterior monitors hooked up really well the first time, whether using the hdmi connection or my adaptors to the usb-c or the usb ports. Graphic conveyance to the exterior monitors do not have a noticeable lag; both my exterior monitors are basic under $100 each.\n\n*Keyboard: I like that it has a full number pad on the right, when needed. Backlit keys are helpful and the shortcut of  fn-spacebar is really nice, rather than on my HP where I have to find that particular key above the numbers when it is already dark. I haven't gotten use to consistently be able to ctrl-v or ctrl-c, which I do a lot, and a third of the time it didn't work the first time (probably not touching the right buttons smoothly), hopefully I'll get use to the new button locations.\n\n*Bloatware: It did come with some that I've needed to take time to remove but it does not seem excessive.",

      "body": "Okay, great! Here's a review based on the information you provided, with some common observations about this model:\nTitle: Lenovo Yoga 7i 16\" - A Versatile 2-in-1 with a Stunning Display\nReview:\nI recently purchased the Lenovo Yoga 7i 16\" 2-in-1 laptop from Best Buy, and I'm very happy with it so far. I primarily use it for work and creative tasks, and it has been a fantastic upgrade from my old machine.\nPros:\n * Beautiful 2K Touchscreen: The 16\" 2K touchscreen display is the star of the show. It's bright, sharp, and vibrant, making it perfect for watching movies, editing photos, or just browsing the web. The touch functionality is responsive and accurate, and the 2-in-1 design allows me to use it as a tablet when needed.\n * Powerful Performance: The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD provide plenty of power for demanding tasks. I can easily multitask between multiple applications, edit large images, and even do some light gaming without any lag.\n * Long Battery Life: I can easily get through a full workday on a single charge, which is essential for me.\n * Solid Build Quality: The laptop feels well-built and sturdy, with a premium aluminum chassis.\n * Versatile 2-in-1 Design: The 360-degree hinge allows me to use the laptop in various modes, including laptop, tent, stand, and tablet. This versatility is great for presentations, watching movies, or taking notes.\n * Excellent Keyboard and Trackpad: The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with good key travel and backlighting. The trackpad is also large and responsive.\nCons:\n * A Bit Heavy:  At around 4.6 lbs, it's not the lightest 16\" laptop out there. If portability is a top priority, you might want to consider a smaller model.\n * Limited Ports: While it has essential ports, some users might find the selection limited, especially if they need more USB-A ports.\n * Speakers Could Be Better: The speakers are decent but not amazing. They lack bass and can sound a bit tinny at higher volumes.\nOverall:\nThe Lenovo Yoga 7i 16\" is a fantastic 2-in-1 laptop that offers a great combination of performance, versatility, and portability. The stunning display, powerful performance, and long battery life make it a great choice for work, entertainment, and creative tasks. While it's a bit heavy and has limited ports, the pros far outweigh the cons. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium 2-in-1 laptop.\nRating: 4.5 out of 5 stars \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd",

The Lenovo Yoga 7i really stands out as a strong contender, especially if you need flexibility, performance, and a large screen without entering high-end price territory.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 2-in-1 Flexibility That Actually Feels Useful: The 360\u00b0 hinge isn't just a gimmick; I loved being able to flip it into tent mode to watch Netflix at night or prop it up in tablet mode to sketch or jot down ideas. It feels natural and smooth to switch modes, which makes multitasking easier.\n\u2022 Gorgeous 2K Touchscreen: The screen is bright and crisp, with colors that truly pop. Whether I\u2019m on Zoom, reviewing documents, or watching YouTube, the quality makes everything more enjoyable. The 16:10 aspect ratio gives extra screen real estate that's great for side-by-side windows or spreadsheets.\n\u2022 Fast, Responsive Performance: The new Intel Core Ultra 7 handled everything I threw at it, streaming, browsing with way too many tabs open, and working on documents, all without slowing down. It feels quick and smooth. For me, the 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD are more than enough, making a noticeable difference in speed and storage space.\n\u2022 Battery That Lasts All Day: I didn\u2019t find myself chained to a charger. I could get through most of the day without thinking about the battery, which is huge when you're on the go.\n\u2022 Solid, Sleek Build: It looks and feels like a premium laptop, with a sturdy, minimalist design and a professional appearance. The Storm Grey color is understated but really sharp.\n\nCons:\n\u2022 It\u2019s a Bit Large for a Tablet: The 16\u201d screen is amazing for working, but it\u2019s not exactly something you want to hold in your arms like an iPad. That said, it\u2019s perfect on a desk, couch, or stand.\n\u2022 Not for Gamers or Heavy Video Editing: It runs programs flawlessly every day, but if you\u2019re looking to game or do advanced video editing, this isn\u2019t the machine for you. There\u2019s no dedicated graphics card.\n\u2022 Ports Are Limited: You\u2019ll likely need a USB-C hub if you prefer having HDMI, SD card slots, or additional USB ports. I didn\u2019t mind this, but it\u2019s something to plan for.\n\u2022 It Can Get Warm During Heavy Use: I noticed the fan kicks in when I\u2019m multitasking heavily. It\u2019s not excessively loud, but worth mentioning if you\u2019re noise-sensitive.\n\nIf you're someone like me who wears multiple hats, student, professional, parent, counselor, the Yoga 7i really meets you where you\u2019re at. It\u2019s powerful, reliable, and doesn\u2019t feel overly complicated. It supports productivity and personal time, which is rare to find in one package.  This laptop makes a strong case for being your next everyday companion. It handles Zoom calls, Google Docs, research, Netflix, and everything in between with style and ease. For the price point, it gives a great balance of power, design, and features. It\u2019s not flashy, it just works, and that\u2019s exactly what I need most days.",

However, for me there was one relatively major dealbreaker - the screen, color-wise, is very washed out looking, even by IPS and sRGB standards. You might not notice it in the store, but was very apparent to me at home when comparing it to other devices. Attempting to boost the color saturation in the display settings and lowering the brightness did not help this, nor did updating the display drivers or changing the color profile. The result is an image quality more comparable to VA displays on budget laptops. I know this is something that might not bother everyone, but for this price range I felt that it should have been better than this. For me, it was enough to return it.",

      "title": "Serving its Purpose",
      "body": "I waited a couple of months after purchasing this to write a review to ensure I could acclimate myself to the layout of this computer compared to others. Bottomline....I wish I would have selected a different computer. \n\nLet's start with the pros: It's a Touchscreen model and the touchscreen is very receptive and responds to demands. My previous computer was not TS and I missed it, so when I saw this model, decided I wanted it. \nI was a little taken back by the size when I got it as I expected it to be a little larger based on the description, but overall, the weight is good, and it is simple to transport from one place to another. \n\nIt is called \"Yoga\" for a reason. It can be folded in a couple of different ways. When giving a brief, I fold in half to speak. No extra papers, or cards. Just a sleek component holding my notes.   \n\nIt comes with ample memory and I feel as if I have more than enough to meet my demands, including with the graphics I do online. \n\nI have used the camera a few times for meetings, and it works well. Images are clear and there is little to no lag time (I have horrible internet service in the country, so this is a big deal for me.) I also like the fact I can slide the little tab on the camera to an \"off\" position when not in use. \n\nCons: Layout. The most annoying feature is the power button is on the right side (yes side) of the computer. If you try to move or adjust the laptop on a surface and you touch the side, boom, your computer shuts off. Using it while sitting on the sofa, touches the side of your leg or hand - off it goes again. Who in their right mind would put a power button the side? \n\nThe top row of buttons in my opinion leaves a lot to be desired. Most computer brands are consistent with where the buttons are...not this model. Sound is all the way on the top left, there is no \"end\" button on the top row (only in the keypad which you have to have the number lock off). \n\nThe touch pad while large, does not have defined cutoffs for left/right clicks. This a major cause of frustration. You have a super large touch pad that its usage is not as optimized as it could/should be. \n\nThe system is overly touchy and tends to \"bounce.\"  I'm typing in one place, and I end up somewhere else. It is a waste of my time and energy repeating work I've completed, especially during quick turnarounds.\n\nCo-Pilot: I loathe and detest this feature. I don't need it and do not want it. I turn it off and as soon as I have to restart my computer, it magically reappears as if it feels I need it for my online existence. It appears in every aspect of my online experience, including email.\n\nSpeaking of having to restart. The reason I purchased a new computer is because I needed something that would process quickly. This system freezes up more than a newer system should (I think in part due to the McAfee insists I purchase additional upgrades.) I have never had to restart a new computer because it freezes as much as this one. Extremely disappointing.\n\nWhile this computer is serving its purpose, it is not what I expected. I had this preconceived notion it would be better and unfortunately; it has been a frustrating purchase for me and I feel I could have spent my money differently.",

He told me that I could change the term of my lease later to 3-months. Actually, I couldn\u2019t. You either overpay the monthly amount due or pay off the amount in full if you wanted to end the lease sooner! I went ahead and paid the amount in full which was my original intention. So, I was put through that ridiculous process for no reason. Very misleading sales tactic. I do not have any grouses with the store which is why I\u2019m not giving them 1-star review but would recommend training the sales rep so they do not engage in misleading tactics to gain \u201caccounts\u201d.",

Its just not really a work horse for what you're paying for and getting. Its a middle of the road getter done machine.

I now have to return this and buy a laptop that actually has the ability to input an external microphone through a jack (not blue tooth!!!).  It cost me $175 to have a technician try and this to work (the Dell shares the headphone output jack with the microphone input jack.  He tried installing drivers, etc, only to find out that finally determine this unit DOES NOT support a line-in microphone through a jack.  Yet - the specs SAY it does have this feature.  I am really mad at Best Buy for recommending this unit to me - AND, to the Geek Squad, who dialed into my unit and after wasting two hours of my time, admitted that he was unable to figure this out and sent me to the 800 number to book an on-site appointment - something that can't be done on the 800 number.  After doing some research I decided to go back to buying a Dell, and because I have the yearly service package, I am going to expect the Geek Squad at the store that sold me this dumb Lenovo and have them reinstall EVERYTHING on the new unit - of course, once I confirm that indeed the DELL is able to support the external mic (my old Dell does so I can't see why the new one wouldn't but who knows these days...)
