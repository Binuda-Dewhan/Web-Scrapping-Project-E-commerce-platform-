The full HD display is clear and vibrant, and I appreciate the extra screen space when multitasking.\n\nWhat stands out most is the portability. It\u2019s lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry to class, and for traveling. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the overall build feels sturdy.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of memory handle everyday tasks with ease. I use it for office apps, video calls, light photo editing, and streaming\u2014and it keeps up without slowing down. The SSD also helps everything boot up and load quickly.\n\nIt's a reliable laptop that gets the job done without breaking the bank. It offers the right balance of value, performance, and convenience.

The 15.6\" Full HD touchscreen has nice thin bezels that add to the contemporary appearance, and the build quality feels solid with a beautiful blue finish that catches the light perfectly. Combined with the capable AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD that handle everyday tasks smoothly, this laptop delivers both attractive design and reliable performance - it's the kind of device you'd be proud to use anywhere, as it definitely doesn't look like a budget laptop despite its affordable price range.",

The team member at my Best Buy assured me this Lenovo would fit my needs and it surely does.  The screen is the perfect size for us; it's lightweight so easily portable.

The final straw was the last Microsoft update took nearly 24 hours to complete! This computer is used minimally and NOTHING gets stored on it, so it has a perfect amount of storage, bells & whistles. My husband (he is the primary user) is very happy with this laptop. I had the Geek Squad set up this laptop, merging over the small amount of data on the previous one. They also wiped the old one and recycled it for me. Finishing the setup at home was relatively quick and I appreciated the extra time the tech took to walk me through a few of the steps i would need to complete at home. Definitely recommend this laptop if you're looking for a basic machine and don't need screaming fast graphics for video games, etc.",

The \"8GB\" ram is soldered onto the motherboard and CANNOT be upgraded. It gets worse though. Your system will not actually be given the full \"8GB\" of memory. More like 5.6 GB after the AMD graphics card allocates memory for itself. A new computer is not usable with 5 GB ram. You will be buying a new computer within a couple years because it will be so slow. Get a computer with 16GB Ram right off the bat. 8 GB is the BARE minimum these days.",

It was priced at $319 and you had one slot to upgrade the memory to 16GB.  Came with 512GB of storage and Intel Iris XE graphics. Perfect value laptop for what you got.   As soon as I received this laptop, I noticed that the memory is locked to 8GB and no RAM slot to upgrade to 16GB.  Even for basic users, standard should be 16GB, and for gamers minimum 32GB-64GB.  The fact you can't upgrade this to 16GB is enough for me to return this device.  Yes yes, you can gain some performance with having it soldered on, but at the end of the day, you are still locked at 8GB.  On top of that, they cut the storage in half, from 512GB to 256GB. \n Granted you can upgrade storage but it's just another cheap tactic.  Bad move Lenovo, you can have it back.",
