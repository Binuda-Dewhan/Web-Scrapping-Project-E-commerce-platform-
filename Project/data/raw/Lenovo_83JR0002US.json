After using it for three weeks, I am pleased with my choice. To enhance my setup, I recently acquired a mobile 3-in-1 screen expansion, ensuring I am well-equipped for the demands of multiple screens when the stock exchange opens.",

I have been using Macs for the last 8-9 years but now have a work situation that require PC for network security reasons. \nBattery life is amazing. >12 hours off the charger and I still have juice. \nThis baby is perfect. I\u2019ve had it for almost a week. Will comeback and update if there are any changes.",

I have worked for several days to get it the way I want it and to experience what is new.  I have changed my mind.  It is not a bad little laptop at all.  It has some options that are quite nice and helpful.  It is just the right size, the screen is very bright and the speed has improved.  I find it to be satisfactory. By the way, if you are shopping Best Buy in Bloomington/Normal, IL ask for Chris.  Quite a nice kid!",
